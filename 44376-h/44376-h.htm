<h2><a name="PREFACE1" id="PREFACE1">PREFACE</a><br />
TO THE FIRST EDITION.</h2>

<p>Having some years ago, during a pilgrimage to the Holy City
of Jerusalem, gained admission to the courts of the ancient
Temple of the Knights Templars, which still exists on Mount
Moriah in a perfect state of preservation as a Mussulman
Mosque, and having visited many of the ruined fortresses and
castles of the ancient order of the Temple, whose shattered walls
are still to be seen at intervals in Palestine and in Syria, from
Gaza to Antioch, and from the mountains of the Dead Sea to the
shores of the Mediterranean, I naturally became greatly interested
in the history of the order, and in the numerous remains and
memorials of the Knights Templars still to be met with in
various stages of decay and ruin in almost every part of Europe.
The recent restoration of the Temple Church at London, the
most beautiful and the best preserved of all the ancient ecclesiastical
edifices of the western provinces of the Temple, first
suggested to me the idea of writing a short historical account of
the varied fortunes of that great religious and military fraternity
of knights and monks by whom it was erected, and of their dark
and terrible end.</p>

<p>Born during the first fervour of the Crusaders, the Templars
were flattered and aggrandized as long as their great military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[Pg ii]</a></span>
power and religious fanaticism could be made available for the support
of the Eastern church and the retention of the Holy Land;
but when the crescent had ultimately triumphed over the cross, and
the religious and military enthusiasm of Christendom had died
away, they encountered the basest ingratitude in return for the
services they had rendered to the Christian faith, and were plundered,
persecuted, and condemned to a cruel death by those who
ought in justice to have been their defenders and supporters.</p>

<p>The memory of these holy warriors is embalmed in all our recollections
of the wars of the cross; they were the bulwarks of
the Latin kingdom of Jerusalem during the short period of its
existence, and were the last band of Europe’s host that contended
for the possession of Palestine. To the vows of the monk and
the austere life of the convent, they added the discipline of the
camp, and the stern duties of the military life, joining “the fine
vocation of the sword and lance” with the holy zeal and body-bending
toil of a poor brotherhood. The vulgar notion that they
were as wicked as they were fearless and brave, has not yet been
entirely exploded; but it is hoped that the copious account of
the proceedings against the order in this country given in the
ensuing volume, will dispel many unfounded prejudices still
entertained against the fraternity, and excite emotions of admiration
for their constancy and courage, and of pity for their unmerited
and cruel fate.</p>

<p>The accounts, even of the best of the ancient historians concerning
the Templars ought not to be implicitly relied upon. William
of Tyre, for instance, tells us that Nassr-ed-deen, son of sultan
Abbas, was taken prisoner by the Templars, and whilst in their
hands became a convert to Christianity; that he had learned the
rudiments of the Latin language, and earnestly sought to be
baptized, but that the Templars were bribed with sixty thousand
pieces of gold to surrender him to his enemies in Egypt,
where certain death awaited him; and that they stood by to see
him bound hand and foot with chains, and placed in an iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[Pg iii]</a></span>
cage, to be conducted across the desert to Cairo. The Arabian
historians, on the other hand, tell us that Nassr-ed-deen and
his father murdered the caliph, threw his body into a well, and
then fled into Palestine; that the sister of the murdered caliph
wrote immediately to the commander of the garrison of the
Knights Templars at Gaza, offering a handsome reward for the
capture of the fugitives; that they were accordingly intercepted,
and Nassr-ed-deen was sent to Cairo, where the female relations
of the caliph caused his body to be cut into small pieces in the
seraglio! The above act has constantly been made a matter of
grave accusation against the Templars; but what a different complexion
does the case assume on the testimony of the Arabian authorities!
It must be remembered that William, archbishop of
Tyre, was hostile to the order on account of its vast powers and privileges,
and carried his complaints to a general council of the Church
at Rome. He is abandoned, in everything that he says to the
prejudice of the fraternity, by James of Vitry, bishop of Acre, a
learned and most talented prelate, who wrote in Palestine subsequently
to William of Tyre, and has copied largely from the
history of the latter. The bishop of Acre speaks of the Templars
in the highest terms, and declares that they were universally
loved by all men for their piety and humility.</p>

<p>The celebrated orientalist Von Hammer has recently brought
forward various extraordinary and unfounded charges, destitute
of all authority, against the Templars; and Wilcke, who has
written a German history of the order, seems to have imbibed
all the vulgar prejudices against the fraternity. I might have
added to the interest of the ensuing work, by making the Templars
horrible and atrocious villains; but I have endeavoured to
write a fair and impartial account of the order, not slavishly
adopting everything I find detailed in ancient writers, but such
matters only as I believe, after a careful examination of the best
authorities, to be true.</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE3" id="PREFACE3">PREFACE</a><br />
TO THE THIRD EDITION.</h2>

<p>The favourable reception given to the first edition of the ensuing
work, and the interest that was taken in the extraordinary
and romantic career of the Knights Templars, induced me to
publish a second edition greatly enlarged, and to introduce
various collateral matters of an antiquarian and local character,
interesting only to a comparatively small number of readers.
This enlarged edition having been exhausted, it occurred to me,
in preparing a third edition for the press, that the work might
be materially shortened and reduced in price without in anywise
detracting from its value and interest as a record of the chief
events of one of the most remarkable and interesting periods
of history, and of the extraordinary and romantic achievements
of the first and most ancient of the great religio-military orders
of knights and monks established during the crusades.</p>

<p>The dry matters of detail, of local and partial interest, which
interfered with the continuity of the main narrative, have been
struck out of the body of the work, and the more striking incidents
of the history have been thus brought into greater prominence.
The long Latin and French extracts from the old
chronicles have also been discarded from the notes, but the
historical references have been preserved to enable the reader, if
he thinks fit, to study the quaint and curious language of the
originals. By these means, and by enlarging the size of the
page, the work has been compressed into a smaller compass, and
the price reduced nearly one half.</p>

<p>It is hoped that these alterations will be found to be improvements.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</a></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>“Go forth to battle and employ your substance and your persons for the advancement of
God’s religion. Verily, God loveth those who fight for his religion in battle array.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Koran</span>,
<i>chapter 56, entitled</i> <span class="smcap">Battle Array</span>.</p>

<p>“O Prophet, stir up the faithful to war! If twenty of you persevere with constancy they
shall overcome two hundred, and if there be one hundred of you they shall overcome one
thousand of those who believe not.”&mdash;<i>Chapter 8, entitled</i> <span class="smcap">The Spoils</span>.</p>

<p>“Verily, if God pleased, he could take vengeance on the unbelievers without your assistance,
but he commandeth you to fight his battles that he may prove the one of you by the
other; and as to those who fight in defence of God’s true religion, God will not suffer their
works to perish.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Koran</span>, <i>chapter 47, entitled</i> <span class="smcap">War</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p class="p2">To be propagated by the sword was a vital principle of
Mahommedanism. War against infidels for the establishment
and extension of the faith was commanded by the Prophet, and
the solemn injunction became hallowed and perpetuated by
success.</p>

<p>A century after the death of Mahomet, the Moslems had extended
their religion and their arms from India to the Atlantic
Ocean; they had subdued and converted, by the power of the
sword, Persia and Egypt, and all the north of Africa, from the
mouth of the Nile to the extreme western boundary of that vast
continent; they overran Spain, invaded France, and turning
their footsteps towards Italy they entered the kingdoms of
Naples and Genoa, threatened Rome, and subjected the island
of Sicily to the laws and the religion of their Prophet. But at
the very period when they were about to plant the Koran in the
very heart of Europe, and were advancing with rapid strides to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
universal dominion, intestine dissensions broke out amongst
them which undermined their power, and Europe was released
from the dread and danger of Saracen dominion.</p>

<p>In the tenth century of the Christian era, however, the ferocious
and barbarous Turcomans appeared as the patrons of
Mahommedanism, and the propagators of the Koran. These
were wild pastoral tribes of shepherds and hunters, who descended
from the frozen plains to the north of the Caspian,
conquered Persia, embraced the religion and the law of Mahomet,
and became united under the standard of the Prophet into one
great and powerful nation. They overran the greater part of
the Asiatic continent, destroyed the churches of the Christians
and the temples of the Pagans, and appeared (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1084) in warlike
array on the Asiatic shore of the Hellespont in front of
Constantinople. The terrified emperor Alexius sent urgent
letters to the Pope and the christian princes of Europe, exhorting
them to assist him and their common Christianity in the perilous
crisis. The preachings of Peter the hermit, and the exhortations
of the Pope, forthwith aroused Christendom; Europe was
armed and precipitated upon Asia; the Turkish power was
broken; the Christian provinces of the Greek empire of Constantinople
were recovered from the grasp of the infidels; and
the Latin kingdom of Jerusalem was reared upon the ruins of
the Turkish empire of sultan Soliman. The monastic and
military order of the Temple was then called into existence for
the purpose of checking the power of the infidels, and fighting
the battles of Christendom in the plains of Asia. “Suggested
by fanaticism,” as Gibbon observes, but guided by an intelligent
and far reaching policy, it became the firmest bulwark of Christianity
in the East, and mainly contributed to preserve Europe
from Turkish desolation, and probably from Turkish conquest.</p>

<p>Many grave and improbable charges have been brought against
the Templars by monks and priests who wrote in Europe concerning
events in the Holy Land, and who regarded the vast pri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>vileges
of the order with indignation and aversion. Matthew Paris
tells us that they were leagued with the infidels, and fought
pitched battles with the rival order of Saint John; but as contemporary
historians of Palestine, who describe the exploits of the
Templars, and were eye-witnesses of their career, make no mention
of such occurrences, and as no allusion is made to them in
the letters of the Pope addressed to the Grand Master of the
order of Saint John shortly after the date of these pretended
battles, I have omitted all mention of them, feeling convinced,
after a careful examination of the best authorities, that they
never did take place.</p>

<p>At this distant day, when the times and scenes in which the
Templars acted are changed, and the deep religious fervour and
warm fresh feelings of bygone ages have given way to a cold and
calculating philosophy, we may doubt the sincerity of the military
friars, exclaim against their credulity, and deride their zeal;
but when we call to mind the hardships and fatigues, the dangers,
sufferings, and death, to which they voluntarily devoted themselves
in a far distant land, the sacrifice of personal comforts, of
the ties of kindred, and of all the endearments of domestic
life, which they made without any prospect of worldly gain or
temporal advantage, for objects which they believed to be just,
and noble, and righteous, we must ever rank the generous impulses
by which they were actuated among the sublime emotions
which can influence the human character in those periods when
men feel rather than calculate, before knowledge has chilled the
sensibility, or selfish indifference hardened the heart.</p>

<p class="p2">The natural desire of visiting those holy spots which have
been sanctified by the presence, and rendered memorable by the
sufferings, of the Son of God, drew, during the early ages of
Christianity, crowds of devout worshippers and pilgrims to Jerusalem.
Among the most illustrious and enthusiastic of the
many wanderers to the Holy City was the empress Helena, the
mother of Constantine, who, with the warm feelings of a recent
conversion, visited in person every place and every object in
Palestine associated with the memory of him who died for man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>kind
on the blessed cross. With a holy zeal and a lively enthusiasm,
she attempted to fix by unquestionable tradition the
scene of each memorable event in the gospel narrative; and
Christendom is indebted to her for the real or pretended discovery
(about two hundred and ninety-eight years after the death
of Christ) of the Holy Sepulchre. Over this sacred monument
the empress and her son Constantine caused to be erected the
magnificent church of the Resurrection, or, as it is now called,
the church of the Holy Sepulchre; and they adorned all those
places in the Holy Land which remind us most forcibly of the
earthly existence and death of Jesus Christ, with magnificent
churches and religious houses.</p>

<p>The example of this pious princess, and the pretended discoveries
made by her of holy relics, caused a great increase in the
pilgrimages to Jerusalem. The conquest of Palestine by the
Arabians, (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 637,) stimulated rather than suppressed them; it
added to the merit by increasing the danger and difficulty of the
undertaking, whilst the enthusiasm which prompted the long
and perilous journey was increased by the natural feelings of
sorrow and indignation at the loss of the holy places, and the
possession of them by the conquering infidels. Year after year,
and century after century, hundreds and thousands of both
sexes, of all ranks and every age, the monarch and the peasant,
the noble and the beggar, flocked to the shrines and the altars of
Palestine. They visited, with pious affection, Bethlehem, where
the Saviour first saw the light; they bathed in the waters of the
river Jordan, wherein he was baptized, and wept and prayed
upon Mount Calvary, where he was crucified.</p>

<p>On the conquest of Jerusalem by the Arabians, the security of
the christian population had been provided for in a solemn
guarantee given under the hand and seal of the caliph Omar, to
Sophronius the patriarch. One fourth of the entire city, with
the church of the Resurrection, the Holy Sepulchre, and the
great Latin convent, had been left in the hands of the Christians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
and the pilgrims were permitted, on payment of a trifling tribute,
freely to visit the various objects of their regard. When the
sceptre was transferred from the family of the Abassides to the
Fatimites, and the caliphs of Egypt obtained possession of Palestine,
the same mild and tolerant government was continued.
In the eleventh century, the zeal of pilgrimage had reached its
height, and the caravans of pilgrims had become so numerous as
to be styled <i>the armies of the Lord</i>. The old and the young,
women and children, flocked in crowds to Jerusalem, and in the
year 1064 the Holy Sepulchre was visited by an enthusiastic
band of seven thousand pilgrims. The year following, however,
Jerusalem was conquered by the wild Turcomans, three
thousand of the citizens were massacred, and the command over
the holy city and territory was confided to the emir Ortok, the
chief of a savage pastoral tribe.</p>

<p>Under the iron yoke of these fierce northern strangers, the
Christians were fearfully oppressed; they were driven from their
churches; divine worship was ridiculed and interrupted; and the
patriarch of the Holy City was dragged by the hair of his head
over the sacred pavement of the church of the Resurrection, and
cast into a dungeon, to extort a ransom from the sympathy of
his flock. The pilgrims who, through innumerable perils, had
reached the gates of the Holy City, were plundered, imprisoned,
and frequently massacred; a piece of gold, was exacted as the price
of admission to the holy sepulchre, and many, unable to pay the
tax, were driven by the swords of the Turcomans from the very
threshold of the object of all their hopes, the bourne of their
long pilgrimage, and were compelled to retrace their weary steps
in sorrow and anguish to their distant homes. The intelligence
of these cruelties aroused the religious chivalry of Christendom;
“a nerve was touched of exquisite feeling, and the sensation
vibrated to the heart of Europe.” Then arose the wild enthusiasm
of the crusades, and men of all ranks, and even monks and
priests, animated by the exhortations of the pope and the preach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>ings
of Peter the Hermit, flew to arms, and enthusiastically
undertook “the pious and glorious enterprize” of rescuing the
holy sepulchre of Christ from the foul abominations of the
heathen.</p>

<p>When intelligence of the <span class="smcap">capture of Jerusalem</span> by the
<span class="smcap">Crusaders</span> (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1099) had been conveyed to Europe, the zeal of
pilgrimage blazed forth with increased fierceness: it had gathered
intensity from the interval of its suppression by the wild Turcomans,
and promiscuous crowds of both sexes, old men and
children, virgins and matrons, thinking the road then open and
the journey practicable, successively pressed forwards towards
the Holy City. The infidels had indeed been driven out of
Jerusalem, but not out of Palestine. The lofty mountains bordering
the sea coast were infested by warlike bands of fugitive
Mussulmen, who maintained themselves in various impregnable
castles and strongholds, from whence they issued forth upon the
high-roads, cut off the communication between Jerusalem and
the sea-ports, and revenged themselves for the loss of their habitations
and property by the indiscriminate pillage of all travellers.
The Bedouin horsemen, moreover, making rapid incursions
from beyond the Jordan, frequently kept up a desultory and
irregular warfare in the plains; and the pilgrims, consequently,
whether they approached the Holy City by land or by sea,
were alike exposed to almost daily hostility, to plunder, and to
death.</p>

<p>To alleviate the dangers and distresses to which they were
exposed, to guard the honour of the saintly virgins and matrons,
and to protect the gray hairs of the venerable palmer, nine noble
knights, who had greatly distinguished themselves at the siege
and capture of Jerusalem, formed a holy brotherhood in arms,
and entered into a solemn compact to aid one another in clearing
the highways, and in protecting the pilgrims through the passes
and defiles of the mountains to the Holy City. Warmed with
the religious and military fervour of the day, and animated by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
the sacredness of the cause to which they had devoted their
swords, they called themselves the <i>Poor Fellow-soldiers of Jesus
Christ</i>. They renounced the world and its pleasures, and in the
holy church of the Resurrection, in the presence of the patriarch
of Jerusalem, they embraced vows of perpetual chastity, obedience,
and poverty, after the manner of monks. Uniting in
themselves the two most popular qualities of the age, devotion
and valour, and exercising them in the most popular of all enterprises,
they speedily acquired a famous reputation.</p>

<p>At first, we are told, they had no church, and no particular
place of abode, but in the year of our Lord 1118, (nineteen years
after the conquest of Jerusalem by the Crusaders,) they had rendered
such good and acceptable service to the Christians, that
Baldwin the Second, king of Jerusalem, granted them a place of
habitation within the sacred inclosure of the Temple on Mount
Moriah, amid those holy and magnificent structures, partly
erected by the Christian Emperor Justinian, and partly built by
the Caliph Omar, which were then exhibited by the monks and
priests of Jerusalem, whose restless zeal led them to practise on
the credulity of the pilgrims, and to multiply relics and all objects
likely to be sacred in their eyes, as the <span class="smcap">Temple of Solomon</span>,
whence the Poor Fellow-soldiers of Jesus Christ came thenceforth
to be known by the name of “<span class="smcap">the Knighthood of the
Temple of Solomon</span>.”</p>

<p>By the Mussulmen, the site of the great Jewish temple on
Mount Moriah has always been regarded with peculiar veneration.
Mahomet, in the first year of the publication of the Koran, directed
his followers, when at prayer, to turn their faces towards
it, and pilgrimages have constantly been made to the holy spot
by devout Moslems. On the conquest of Jerusalem by the
Arabians, it was the first care of the Caliph Omar to rebuild
“the Temple of the Lord.” Assisted by the principal chieftains
of his army, the Commander of the Faithful undertook the pious
office of clearing the ground with his own hands, and of tracing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
out the foundations of the magnificent mosque which now crowns
with its dark and swelling dome the elevated summit of Mount
Moriah.</p>

<p>This great house of prayer, the most holy Mussulman Temple
in the world after that of Mecca, is erected over the spot where
“Solomon began to build the house of the Lord at Jerusalem on
Mount Moriah, where the Lord appeared unto David his father,
in the place that David had prepared in the threshing-floor of
Ornan the Jebusite.” It remains to this day in a state of perfect
preservation, and is one of the finest specimens of Saracenic
architecture in existence. It is entered by four spacious doorways,
each door facing one of the cardinal points; the <i>Bab el
D’Jannat</i>, or gate of the garden, on the north; the <i>Bab el Kebla</i>,
or gate of prayer, on the south; the <i>Bab ib’n el Daoud</i>, or the
gate of the son of David, on the east; and the <i>Bab el Garbi</i>, on
the west. By the Arabian geographers it is called <i>Beit Allah</i>,
the house of God, also <i>Beit Almokaddas</i>, or <i>Beit Almacdes</i>, the
holy house. From it Jerusalem derives its Arabic name,
<i>el Kods</i>, the holy, <i>el Schereef</i>, the noble, and <i>el Mobarek</i>, the
blessed.</p>

<p>The crescent had been torn down by the crusaders from the summit
of this great Mussulman Temple, and replaced by an immense
golden cross, and the edifice was consecrated to the services of
the christian religion, but retained its simple appellation of “The
Temple of the Lord.” William, Archbishop of Tyre and Chancellor
of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, gives an interesting account of
the building as it existed in his time during the Latin dominion.
He speaks of the splendid mosaic work on the walls; of the
Arabic characters setting forth the name of the founder, and the
cost of the undertaking; and of the famous rock under the
centre of the dome, which is to this day shown by the Moslems
as the spot whereon the destroying angel stood, “with his
drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem.”<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
rock, he informs us, was left exposed and uncovered for the
space of fifteen years after the conquest of the holy city by the
crusaders, but was, after that period, cased with a handsome
altar of white marble, upon which the priests daily said mass.</p>

<p>To the south of this holy Mussulman temple, on the extreme
edge of the summit of Mount Moriah, and resting against the
modern walls of the town of Jerusalem, stands the venerable
christian church of the Virgin, erected by the Emperor Justinian,
whose stupendous foundations, remaining to this day, fully
justify the astonishing description given of the building by Procopius.
That writer informs us that in order to get a level surface
for the erection of the edifice, it was necessary, on the east
and south sides of the hill, to raise up a wall of masonry from
the valley below, and to construct a vast foundation, partly
composed of solid stone and partly of arches and pillars. The
stones were of such magnitude, that each block required to be
transported in a truck drawn by forty of the emperor’s strongest
oxen; and to admit of the passage of these trucks it was necessary
to widen the roads leading to Jerusalem. The forests of
Lebanon yielded their choicest cedars for the timbers of the
roof, and a quarry of variegated marble, in the adjoining mountains,
furnished the edifice with superb marble columns.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The
interior of this interesting structure, which still remains at
Jerusalem, after a lapse of more than thirteen centuries, in an
excellent state of preservation, is adorned with six rows of
columns, from whence spring arches supporting the cedar beams
and timbers of the roof, and at the end of the building is a
round tower, surmounted by a dome. The vast stones, the walls
of masonry, and the subterranean colonnade raised to support
the south-east angle of the platform whereon the church is
erected, are truly wonderful, and may still be seen by penetrating
through a small door, and descending several flights of steps at
the south-east corner of the enclosure. Adjoining the sacred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
edifice, the emperor erected hospitals, or houses of refuge, for travellers,
sick people, and mendicants of all nations, the foundations
whereof, composed of handsome Roman masonry, are still
visible on either side of the southern end of the building.</p>

<p>On the conquest of Jerusalem by the Moslems, this venerable
church was converted into a mosque, and was called <i>D’Jamé al
Acsa</i>; it was enclosed, together with the great Mussulman
Temple of the Lord erected by the Caliph Omar, within a large
area by a high stone wall, which runs around the edge of the
summit of Mount Moriah, and guards from the profane tread of
the unbeliever the whole of that sacred ground whereon once
stood the gorgeous temple of the wisest of kings. When the
Holy City was taken by the crusaders, the <i>D’Jamé al Acsa</i>, with
the various buildings constructed around it, became the property
of the kings of Jerusalem: and is denominated by William of
Tyre “the palace,” or “royal house to the south of the Temple
of the Lord, vulgarly called the <span class="smcap">Temple of Solomon</span>.” It was
this edifice or temple on Mount Moriah which was appropriated
to the poor fellow-soldiers of Jesus Christ, as they had no <i>church</i>
and no particular place of abode, and from it they derived their
name of Knights Templars.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The canons of the Temple of the
Lord conceded to them the large court extending between that
building and the Temple of Solomon; the king, the patriarch,
and the prelates of Jerusalem, and the barons of the Latin kingdom,
assigned them various gifts and revenues for their maintenance
and support, and the order being now settled in a
regular place of abode, the knights soon began to entertain more
extended views, and to seek a larger theatre for the exercise of
their holy profession.</p>

<p>Their first aim and object had been, as before mentioned,
simply to protect the poor pilgrims, on their journey backwards
and forwards, from the sea-coast to Jerusalem; but as the hostile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
tribes of Mussulmen, which everywhere surrounded the Latin
kingdom, were gradually recovering from the terror into which
they had been plunged by the successful and exterminating
warfare of the first crusaders, and were assuming an aggressive
and threatening attitude, it was determined that the holy warriors
of the Temple should, in addition to the protection of
pilgrims, make the defence of the christian kingdom of Jerusalem,
of the eastern church, and of all the holy places, a part
of their particular profession. The two most distinguished
members of the fraternity were Hugh de Payens and Geoffrey
de St. Aldemar, or St. Omer, two valiant soldiers of the cross,
who had fought with great credit and renown at the siege of
Jerusalem. Hugh de Payens was chosen by the knights to be
the superior of the new religious and military society, by the
title of “The Master of the Temple;” and he has, consequently,
generally been called the founder of the order.</p>

<p>Baldwin, king of Jerusalem, foreseeing that great advantages
would accrue to the Latin kingdom by the increase of the power
and numbers of these holy warriors, despatched two Knights
Templars to St. Bernard, the holy Abbot of Clairvaux, with a
letter, telling him that the Templars whom the Lord had deigned
to raise up, and whom in a wonderful manner he preserved for
the defence of Palestine, desired to obtain from the Holy See
the confirmation of their institution, and a rule for their particular
guidance, and beseeching him “to obtain from the Pope
the approbation of their order, and to induce his holiness to
send succour and subsidies against the enemies of the faith.”<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
Shortly afterwards Hugh de Payens himself proceeded to Rome,
accompanied by Geoffrey de St. Aldemar, and four other brothers
of the order, who were received with great honour and distinction
by Pope Honorius. A great ecclesiastical council was
assembled at Troyes, (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1128,) which Hugh de Payens and
his brethren were invited to attend, and the rules to which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
Templars had subjected themselves being there described, the
holy Abbot of Clairvaux undertook the task of revising and correcting
them, and of forming a code of statutes fit and proper for
the governance of the great religious and military fraternity of
the Temple.</p>

<h3>Regula Pauperum Commilitonum Christi et Templi Salomonis.</h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The rule of the poor fellow soldiers of Jesus Christ and
of the Temple of Solomon</span>,” arranged by St. Bernard, and sanctioned
by the Holy Fathers of the Council of Troyes, for the government
and regulation of the monastic and military society of the Temple, is
principally of a religious character, and of an austere and gloomy cast.
It is divided into seventy-two heads or chapters, and is preceded by a
short prologue, addressed “to all who disdain to follow after their own
wills, and desire with purity of mind to fight for the most high and true
king,” exhorting them to put on the armour of obedience, and to associate
themselves together with piety and humility for the defence of the
holy catholic church; and to employ a pure diligence, and a steady perseverance
in the exercise of their sacred profession, so that they might
share in the happy destiny reserved for the holy warriors who had given
up their lives for Christ.</p>

<p>The rule enjoins severe devotional exercises, self-mortification, fasting,
and prayer, and a constant attendance at matins, vespers, and on all the
services of the church, that “being refreshed and satisfied with heavenly
food, instructed and stablished with heavenly precepts, after the consummation
of the divine mysteries,” none might be afraid of the <i>fight</i>, but
be prepared for the <i>crown</i>. The following extracts from this rule may be
read with interest.</p>

<p>“VIII. In one common hall, or refectory, we will that you take meat
together, where, if your wants cannot be made known by signs, ye are
softly and privately to ask for what you want. If at any time the thing
you require is not to be found, you must seek it with all gentleness, and
with submission and reverence to the board, in remembrance of the words
of the apostle, <i>Eat thy bread in silence</i>, and in emulation of the psalmist,
who says, <i>I have set a watch upon my mouth</i>; that is, I have communed
with myself that I may not offend, that is, with my tongue; that is, I
have guarded my mouth, that I may not speak evil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>“XI. Two and two ought in general to eat together, that one may have
an eye upon another....</p>

<p>“XVII. After the brothers have once departed from the hall to bed, it
must not be permitted any one to speak in public, except it be upon
urgent necessity. But whatever is spoken must be said in an under
tone by the knight to his esquire. Perchance, however, in the interval
between prayers and sleep, it may behove you, from urgent necessity, no
opportunity having occurred during the day, to speak on some military
matter, or concerning the state of your house, with some portion of the
brethren, or with the Master, or with him to whom the government of
the house has been confided: this, then, we order to be done in conformity
with that which hath been written: <i>In many words thou shalt not avoid
sin;</i> and in another place, <i>Life and death are in the hands of the tongue.</i>
In that discourse, therefore, we utterly prohibit scurrility and idle words
moving unto laughter, and on going to bed, if any one among you hath
uttered a foolish saying, we enjoin him, in all humility, and with purity
of devotion, to repeat the Lord’s Prayer.</p>

<p>“XX. ... To all the professed knights, both in winter and summer,
we give, if they can be procured, <span class="small">WHITE GARMENTS</span>, that those who have
cast behind them a dark life may know that they are to commend themselves
to their Creator by a pure and white life. For what is whiteness
but perfect chastity, and chastity is the security of the soul and the health
of the body. And unless every knight shall continue chaste, he shall not
come to perpetual rest, nor see God, as the apostle Paul witnesseth:
<i>Follow after peace with all men, and chastity, without which no man shall
see God</i>....</p>

<p>“XXI. ... Let all the esquires and retainers be clothed in
<i>black</i> garments: but if such cannot be found, let them have what can be
procured in the province where they live, so that they be of one colour,
and such as is of a meaner character, viz. brown.</p>

<p>“XXII. It is granted to none to wear <span class="small">WHITE</span> habits, or to have <span class="small">WHITE</span>
mantles, excepting the above-named knights of Christ.</p>

<p>“XXXVII. We will not that gold or silver, which is the mark of private
wealth, should ever be seen on your bridles, breastplates, or spurs, nor
should it be permitted to any brother to buy such. If, indeed, such like
furniture shall have been charitably bestowed upon you, the gold and
silver must be so coloured, that its splendour and beauty may not impart
to the wearer an appearance of arrogance beyond his fellows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>“XLI. It is in no wise lawful for any of the brothers to receive letters
from his parents, or from any man, or to send letters, without the license
of the Master, or of the procurator. After the brother shall have had
leave, they must be read in the presence of the Master, if it so pleaseth
him. If, indeed, anything whatever shall have been directed to him from
his parents, let him not presume to receive it until information has been
first given to the Master. But in this regulation the Master and the
procurators of the houses are not included.</p>

<p>“XLII. We forbid, and we resolutely condemn, all tales related by
any brother, of the follies and irregularities of which he hath been guilty
in the world, or in military matters, either with his brother or with any
other man. It shall not be permitted him to speak with his brother of the
irregularities of other men, nor of the delights of the flesh with miserable
women; and if by chance he should hear another discoursing of such
things, he shall make him silent, or with the swift foot of obedience he
shall depart from him as soon as he is able, and shall lend not the ear of
the heart to the vender of idle tales.</p>

<p>“XLIII. If any gift shall be made to a brother, let it be taken to the
Master or the treasurer. If, indeed, his friend or his parent will consent
to make the gift only on condition that he useth it himself, he must not
receive it until permission hath been obtained from the Master. And
whosoever shall have received a present, let it not grieve him if it be
given to another. Yea, let him know assuredly, that if he be angry at
it, he striveth against God.</p>

<p>“XLVI. We are all of opinion that none of you should dare to follow
the sport of catching one bird with another: for it is not agreeable unto
religion for you to be addicted unto worldly delights, but rather willingly
to hear the precepts of the Lord, constantly to kneel down to prayer, and
daily to confess your sins before God with sighs and tears. Let no
brother, for the above especial reason, presume to go forth with a man
following such diversions with a hawk, or with any other bird.</p>

<p>“XLVII. Forasmuch as it becometh all religion to behave decently
and humbly without laughter, and to speak sparingly but sensibly, and not
in a loud tone, we specially command and direct every professed brother
that he venture not to shoot in the woods either with a long-bow or a
cross-bow; and for the same reason, that he venture not to accompany
another who shall do the like, except it be for the purpose of protecting
him from the perfidious infidel; neither shall he dare to halloo, or to talk
to a dog, nor shall he spur his horse with a desire of securing the game.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>“LI. Under Divine Providence, as we do believe, this new kind of
religion was introduced by you in the holy places, that is to say, the
union of <span class="small">WARFARE</span> with <span class="small">RELIGION</span>, so that religion, being armed, maketh
her way by the sword, and smiteth the enemy without sin. Therefore
we do rightly adjudge, since ye are called <span class="smcap">Knights of the Temple</span>, that
for your renowned merit, and especial gift of godliness, ye ought to have
lands and men, and possess husbandmen and justly govern them, and
the customary services ought to be specially rendered unto you.</p>

<p>“LV. We permit you to have married brothers in this manner, if such
should seek to participate in the benefit of your fraternity; let both the
man and his wife grant, from and after their death, their respective portions
of property, and whatever more they acquire in after life, to the
unity of the common chapter; and, in the interim, let them exercise an
honest life, and labour to do good to the brethren: but they are not permitted
to appear in the white habit and white mantle. If the husband
dies first, he must leave his portion of the patrimony to the brethren, and
the wife shall have her maintenance out of the residue, and let her depart
therewith; for we consider it most improper that such women should
remain in one and the same house with the brethren who have promised
chastity unto God.</p>

<p>“LVI. It is moreover exceedingly dangerous to join sisters with you
in your holy profession, for the ancient enemy hath drawn many away
from the right path to paradise through the society of women: therefore,
dear brothers, that the flower of righteousness may always flourish
amongst you, let this custom from henceforth be utterly done away with.</p>

<p>“LXIV. The brothers who are journeying through different provinces
should observe the rule, so far as they are able, in their meat and drink,
and let them attend to it in other matters, and live irreproachably, that
they may get a good name out of doors. Let them not tarnish their
religious purpose either by word or deed; let them afford to all with
whom they may be associated, an example of wisdom, and a perseverance
in all good works. Let him with whom they lodge be a man of the best
repute, and, if it be possible, let not the house of the host on that night
be without a light, lest the dark enemy (from whom God preserve us)
should find some opportunity.</p>

<p>“LXVIII. Care must be taken that no brother, powerful or weak,
strong or feeble, desirous of exalting himself, becoming proud by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
degrees, or defending his own fault, remain unchastened. If he showeth
a disposition to amend, let a stricter system of correction be added:
but if by godly admonition and earnest reasoning he will not be
amended, but will go on more and more lifting himself up with pride,
then let him be cast out of the holy flock in obedience to the apostle, <i>Take
away evil from among you.</i> It is necessary that from the society of the
Faithful Brothers the dying sheep be removed. But let the Master, who
<i>ought to hold the staff and the rod in his hand</i>, that is to say, the staff
that he may support the infirmities of the weak, and the rod that he may
with the zeal of rectitude strike down the vices of delinquents; let
him study, with the counsel of the patriarch and with spiritual circumspection,
to act so that, as blessed Maximus saith, The sinner be not
encouraged by easy lenity, nor hardened in his iniquity by immoderate
severity. <span class="smcap">Lastly.</span> We hold it dangerous to all religion to gaze too
much on the countenance of women; and therefore no brother shall
presume to kiss neither widow, nor virgin, nor mother, nor sister, nor
aunt, nor any other woman. Let the knighthood of Christ shun <i>feminine
kisses</i>, through which men have very often been drawn into danger,
so that each, with a pure conscience and secure life, may be able to walk
everlastingly in the sight of God.”</p>

<p class="p2">After the confirmation by a Papal bull of the rules and statutes
of the order, Hugh de Payens proceeded to France, and
from thence he came to England, and the following account is
given of his arrival, in the Saxon chronicle. “This same year,
(<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1128,) Hugh of the Temple came from Jerusalem to the
king in Normandy, and the king received him with much
honour, and gave him much treasure in gold and silver, and
afterwards he sent him into England, and there he was well received
by all good men, and all gave him treasure, and in
Scotland also, and they sent in all a great sum in gold and
silver by him to Jerusalem, and there went with him and after
him so great a number as never before since the days of Pope
Urban.”<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Grants of lands, as well as of money, were at the
same time made to Hugh de Payens and his brethren, some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
which were shortly afterwards confirmed by King Stephen on
his accession to the throne, (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1135.) Among these is a grant
of the manor of Bistelesham made to the Templars by Count
Robert de Ferrara, and a grant of the church of Langeforde in
Bedfordshire made by Simon de Wahull, and Sibylla his wife, and
Walter their son.</p>

<p>Hugh de Payens, before his departure, placed a Knight Templar
at the head of the order in this country, who was called the
Prior of the Temple, and was the procurator and vicegerent of
the Master. It was his duty to manage the estates granted to
the fraternity, and to transmit the revenues to Jerusalem. He
was also delegated with the power of admitting members into
the order, subject to the control and direction of the Master,
and was to provide means of transport for such newly-admitted
brethren to the far east, to enable them to fulfil the duties of
their profession. As the houses of the Temple increased in
number in England, sub-priors came to be appointed, and the
superior of the order in this country was then called the Grand
Prior, and afterwards Master of the Temple.</p>

<p>An astonishing enthusiasm was excited throughout Christendom
in behalf of the Templars; princes and nobles, sovereigns
and their subjects, vied with each other in heaping gifts and
benefits upon them, and scarce a will of importance was made
without an article in it in their favour. Many illustrious persons
on their deathbeds took the vows, that they might be buried in
the habit of the order; and sovereign princes, quitting the
government of their kingdoms, enrolled themselves amongst the
holy fraternity, and bequeathed even their dominions to the
Master and the brethren of the Temple. St. Bernard, at the
request of Hugh de Payens, took up his powerful pen in their
behalf. In a famous discourse “In praise of the New Chivalry,”
the holy abbot sets forth, in eloquent and enthusiastic terms, the
spiritual advantages and blessings enjoyed by the military friars
of the Temple over all other warriors. He draws a curious pic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>ture
of the relative situations and circumstances of the <i>secular</i>
soldiery and the soldiery of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, and shows how different in
the sight of God are the bloodshed and slaughter perpetrated by
the one, from that committed by the other. Addressing himself
to the secular soldiers he says “Ye cover your horses with silken
trappings, and I know not how much fine cloth hangs pendent
from your coats of mail. Ye paint your spears, shields, and saddles;
your bridles and spurs are adorned on all sides with gold,
and silver, and gems, and with all this pomp, with a shameful
fury and a reckless insensibility, ye rush on to death. Are these
military ensigns, or are they not rather the garnishments of
women? Can it happen that the sharp-pointed sword of the
enemy will respect gold, will it spare gems, will it be unable
to penetrate the silken garment? Lastly, as ye yourselves have
often experienced, three things are indispensably necessary to
the success of the soldier; he must be bold, active, and circumspect;
quick in running, prompt in striking; ye, however, to
the disgust of the eye, nourish your hair after the manner of
women, ye gather around your footsteps long and flowing vestures,
ye bury up your delicate and tender hands in ample and
wide-spreading sleeves. Among you, indeed, nought provoketh war
or awakeneth strife, but either an irrational impulse of
anger, or an insane lust of glory, or the covetous desire of possessing
another man’s lands and possessions. In such causes it
is neither safe to slay nor to be slain.</p>

<p>“And now we will briefly display the mode of life of the
Knights of Christ, such as it is in the field and in the convent,
by which means it will be made plainly manifest to what extent
the soldiery of <span class="smcap">God</span> and the soldiery of the <span class="small">WORLD</span> differ from
one another.... The soldiers of Christ live together in
common in an agreeable but frugal manner, without wives, and
without children; and that nothing may be wanting to evangelical
perfection, they dwell together without separate property
of any kind, in one house, under one rule, careful to preserve the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
unity of the spirit in the bond of peace. You may say, that to
the whole multitude there is but one heart and one soul, as each
one in no respect followeth after his own will or desire, but is
diligent to do the will of the Master. They are never idle nor
rambling abroad, but when they are not in the field, that they
may not eat their bread in idleness, they are fitting and repairing
their armour and their clothing, or employing themselves in
such occupations as the will of the Master requireth, or their
common necessities render expedient. Among them there is no
distinction of persons; respect is paid to the best and most virtuous,
not the most noble. They participate in each other’s
honour, they bear one another’s burthens, that they may fulfil
the law of Christ. An insolent expression, a useless undertaking,
immoderate laughter, the least murmur or whispering, if
found out, passeth not without severe rebuke. They detest
cards and dice, they shun the sports of the field, and take no delight
in that ludicrous catching of birds, (hawking,) which men
are wont to indulge in. Jesters, and soothsayers, and storytellers,
scurrilous songs, shows and games, they contemptuously
despise and abominate as vanities and mad follies. They cut
their hair, knowing that, according to the apostle, it is not
seemly in a man to have long hair. They are never combed,
seldom washed, but appear rather with rough neglected hair,
foul with dust, and with skins browned by the sun and their
coats of mail. Moreover, on the approach of battle they fortify
themselves with faith within, and with steel without, and not
with gold, so that armed and not adorned, they may strike terror
into the enemy, rather than awaken his lust of plunder. They
strive earnestly to possess strong and swift horses, but not garnished
with ornaments or decked with trappings, thinking of
battle and of victory, and not of pomp and show, and studying
to inspire fear rather than admiration....</p>

<p>“There is a Temple at Jerusalem in which they dwell together,
unequal, it is true, as a building, to that ancient and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
most famous one of Solomon, but not inferior in glory. For
truly, the entire magnificence of that consisted in corrupt things,
in gold and silver, in carved stone, and in a variety of woods;
but the whole beauty of this resteth in the adornment of an
agreeable conversation, in the godly devotion of its inmates, and
their beautifully-ordered mode of life. That was admired for its
various external beauties, this is venerated for its different virtues
and sacred actions, as becomes the sanctity of the house of God,
who delighteth not so much in polished marbles as in well-ordered
behaviour, and regardeth pure minds more than gilded
walls. The face likewise of this Temple is adorned with arms,
not with gems, and the wall, instead of the ancient golden chapiters,
is covered around with pendent shields. Instead of the
ancient candelabra, censers, and lavers, the house is on all sides
furnished with bridles, saddles, and lances, all which plainly
demonstrate that the soldiers burn with the same zeal for the
house of God, as that which formerly animated their great
leader, when, vehemently enraged, he entered into the Temple,
and with that most sacred hand, armed not with steel, but with
a scourge which he had made of small thongs, drove out the
merchants, poured out the changers’ money, and overthrew the
tables of them that sold doves; most indignantly condemning
the pollution of the house of prayer, by the making of it a place
of merchandize.”</p>

<p>St. Bernard then congratulates Jerusalem on the advent of the
soldiers of Christ, “Be joyful, O Jerusalem,” says he, in the
words of the prophet Isaiah, “and know that the time of thy
visitation hath arrived. Arise now, shake thyself from the dust,
&amp;c., &amp;c. <span class="smcap">Hail</span>, O holy city, hallowed by the tabernacle of the
Most High! <span class="smcap">Hail</span>, city of the great King, wherein so many
wonderful and welcome miracles have been perpetually displayed.
<span class="smcap">Hail</span>, mistress of the nations, princess of provinces,
possession of patriarchs, mother of the prophets and apostles,
initiatress of the faith, glory of the christian people, whom God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
hath on that account always from the beginning permitted to be
visited with affliction, that thou mightest thus be the occasion of
virtue as well as of salvation to brave men. <span class="smcap">Hail</span>, land of promise,
which, formerly flowing only with milk and honey for thy
possessors, now stretchest forth the food of life, and the means
of salvation to the entire world. Most excellent and happy land,
I say, which, receiving the celestial grain from the recess of the
paternal heart, in that most fruitful bosom of thine, has produced
such rich harvests of martyrs from the heavenly seed, and
whose fertile soil has no less manifoldly engendered fruit a
thirtieth, sixtieth, and a hundredfold in the remaining race of
all the faithful throughout the entire world. Whence most
agreeably satiated, and most abundantly crammed with the great
store of thy pleasantness, those who have seen thee diffuse
around them in every place the remembrance of thy abundant
sweetness, and tell of the magnificence of thy glory to the very
end of the earth to those who have not seen thee, and relate the
wonderful things that are done in thee.</p>

<p>“Glorious things are spoken concerning thee, <span class="smcap">city of God</span>!”</p>

</div></div></div>

<p class="p2">Hugh de Payens, having now laid in Europe the foundations
of the great monastic and military institution of the Temple,
which was destined shortly to spread its ramifications to the remotest
quarters of Christendom, returned to Palestine at the
head of a valiant band of newly-elected Templars, drawn principally
from England and France. On their arrival at Jerusalem
they were received with great distinction by the king, the clergy,
and the barons of the Latin kingdom. Hugh de Payens died,
however, shortly after his return, and was succeeded (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1136)
by the Lord Robert, surnamed the Burgundian, (son-in-law of
Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury,) who, after the death of his
wife, had taken the vows and the habit of the Templars.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
this period the fierce religious and military enthusiasm of the
Mussulmen had been again aroused by the warlike Zinghis, and
his son Noureddin, two of the most famous chieftains of the
age. The one was named <i>Emod-ed-deen</i>, “Pillar of religion;”
and the other <i>Nour-ed-deen</i>, “Light of Religion,” vulgarly, Noureddin.
The Templars were worsted by overpowering numbers.
The latin kingdom of Jerusalem was shaken to its foundations,
and the oriental clergy in trepidation and alarm sent urgent letters
to the Pope for assistance.</p>

<p>The Lord Robert, Master of the Temple, had at this period
(<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1146) been succeeded by Everard des Barres, Prior of
France, who convened a general chapter of the order at Paris,
which was attended by Pope Eugenius the Third, Louis the
Seventh, king of France, and many prelates, princes, and nobles,
from all parts of Christendom. The second crusade was there
arranged, and the Templars, with the sanction of the Pope,
assumed the blood-red cross, the symbol of martyrdom, as the
distinguishing badge of the order, which was appointed to be
worn on their habits and mantles on the left side of the breast
over the heart, whence they came afterwards to be known by the
name of the <i>Red Friars</i> and the <i>Red Cross Knights</i>. At this
famous assembly various donations were made to the Templars,
to enable them to provide more effectually for the defence of the
Holy Land. Bernard Baliol, through love of God and for the
good of his soul, granted them his estate of Wedelee, in Hertfordshire,
which afterwards formed part of the preceptory of
Temple Dynnesley. This grant is expressed to be made at the
chapter held at Easter, in Paris, in the presence of the Pope, the
king of France, several archbishops, and one hundred and thirty
Knights Templars clad in white mantles.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Brother Everard des Barres, the newly-elected Master of the
Temple, having collected together all the brethren from the
western provinces, joined the second crusade to Palestine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
During the march through Asia Minor, the rear of the christian
army was protected by the Templars, who greatly signalized
themselves on every occasion. Odo of Deuil, or Diagolum, the
chaplain of King Louis, and his constant attendant upon this
expedition, informs us that the king loved to see the frugality
and simplicity of the Templars, and to imitate it; he praised
their union and disinterestedness, admired above all things the
attention they paid to their accoutrements, and their care in husbanding
and preserving their equipage and munitions of war,
and proposed them as a model to the rest of the army.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Conrad, emperor of Germany, had preceded King Louis at the
head of a powerful army, which was cut to pieces by the infidels
in the north of Asia; he fled to Constantinople, embarked on
board some merchant vessels, and arrived with only a few attendants
at Jerusalem, where he was received and entertained by the
Templars, and was lodged in the Temple in the Holy City.
Shortly afterwards King Louis arrived, accompanied by the new
Master of the Temple, Everard des Barres; and the Templars
now unfolded for the first time the red-cross banner in the field
of battle. This was a white standard made of woollen stuff,
having in the centre of it the blood-red cross granted by Pope
Eugenius. The two monarchs, Louis and Conrad, took the
field, supported by the Templars, and laid siege to the magnificent
city of Damascus, “the Queen of Syria,” which was defended
by the great Noureddin, “Light of religion,” and his
brother <i>Saif-eddin</i>, “Sword of the faith.”</p>

<p>The services rendered by the Templars are thus gratefully recorded
in the following letter sent by Louis, the French king, to
his minister and vicegerent, the famous Suger, abbot of St. Denis:
“I cannot imagine how we could have subsisted for even the
smallest space of time in these parts, had it not been for their
(the Templars’) support and assistance, which have never failed
me from the first day I set foot in these lands up to the time of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
my despatching this letter&mdash;a succour ably afforded and generously
persevered in. I therefore earnestly beseech you, that as
these brothers of the Temple have hitherto been blessed with
the love of God, so now they may be gladdened and sustained
by our love and favour. I have to inform you that they have
lent me a considerable sum of money, which must be repaid to
them quickly, that their house may not suffer, and that I may
keep my word....”<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Among the English nobility who enlisted in the second crusade
were the two renowned warriors, Roger de Mowbray and William
de Warrenne. Roger de Mowbray was one of the most powerful
and warlike of the barons of England, and was one of the victorious
leaders at the famous battle of the standard: he marched
with King Louis to Palestine; fought under the banners of the
Temple against the infidels, and, smitten with admiration of the
piety and valour of the holy warriors of the order, he gave them,
on his return to England, many valuable estates and possessions.
Among these were the manors of Kileby and Witheley, divers
lands in the isle of Axholme, the town of Balshall in the county
of Warwick, and various places in Yorkshire: and so munificent
were his donations, that the Templars conceded to him and to his
heirs various special privileges. About the same period, Stephen,
King of England, granted and confirmed “to God and the blessed
Virgin Mary, and to the brethren of the Knighthood of the Temple
of Solomon at Jerusalem, all the manor of Cressynge, with the advowson
of the church of the same manor, and also the manors of
Egle and Witham.” Queen Matilda, likewise, granted them the
manor of Covele or Cowley in Oxfordshire, two mills in the same
county, common of pasture in Shotover forest, and the church of
Stretton in Rutland. Ralph de Hastings and William de Hastings
also gave to the Templars, in the same reign, (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1152,)
lands at Hurst and Wyxham in Yorkshire, afterwards formed
into the preceptory of Temple Hurst. William Asheby granted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
them the estate whereon the house and church of Temple Bruere
were afterwards erected; and the order continued rapidly to increase
in power and wealth in England and in all parts of
Europe, through the charitable donations of pious Christians.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>After the miserable failure of the second crusade, brother Everard
des Barres, the Master of the Temple, returned to Paris,
with his friend and patron Louis, the French king; and the
Templars, deprived of their chief, were now left, alone and unaided,
to withstand the victorious career of the fanatical Mussulmen.
Their miserable situation is pourtrayed in a melancholy
letter from the treasurer of the order, written to the Master,
Everard des Barres, during his sojourn at the court of the king
of France, informing him of the slaughter of the prince of Antioch
and all his nobility. “We conjure you,” says he, “to
bring with you from beyond sea all our knights and serving
brothers capable of bearing arms. Perchance, alas! with all
your diligence, you may not find one of us alive. Use, therefore,
all imaginable celerity; pray forget not the necessities of
our house: they are such that no tongue can express them. It
is also of the last importance to announce to the Pope, to the
king of France, and to all the princes and prelates of Europe,
the approaching desolation of the Holy Land, to the intent that
they succour us in person, or send us subsidies.”</p>

<p>The Master of the Temple, however, instead of proceeding to
Palestine, abdicated his authority, and entered into the monastery
of Clairvaux, where he devoted the remainder of his days to
the most rigorous penance and mortification. He was succeeded
(<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1151) by Bernard de Tremelay, a nobleman of an illustrious
family in Burgundy, in France, and a valiant and experienced
soldier.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Shortly after his accession to power, the infidels crossed the
Jordan, and advanced within sight of Jerusalem. Their banners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
waved on the summit of the Mount of Olives, and the warlike
sound of their kettle-drums and trumpets was heard within the
sacred precincts of the holy city. They encamped on the mount
over against the Temple; and had the satisfaction of regarding
from a distance the <i>Beit Allah</i>, or Temple of the Lord, their
holy house of prayer; but in a night attack they were defeated
with terrible slaughter, and were pursued all the way to the
Jordan, five thousand of their number being left dead on the
plain.</p>

<p>On the 20th of April, <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1153, the Templars lost their great
patron Saint Bernard, who died in the sixty-third year of his age.
On his deathbed he wrote three letters in behalf of the order.
The first was addressed to the patriarch of Antioch, exhorting
him to protect and encourage the Templars, a thing which the
holy abbot assures him will prove most acceptable to God and
man. The second was written to Melesinda, queen of Jerusalem,
praising her majesty for the favour shown by her to the brethren
of the order; and the third, addressed to Brother André de
Montbard, a Knight Templar, conveys the affectionate salutations
of St. Bernard to the Master and brethren, to whose prayers he
recommends himself.</p>

<p>The same year the Master of the Temple perished at the head
of his knights whilst attempting to carry the important city of
Ascalon by storm. Passing through a breach made in the walls,
he penetrated into the centre of the town, and was there surrounded
and overpowered. The dead bodies of the Master and
his ill-fated knights were exposed in triumph from the walls;
and, according to the testimony of an eye-witness, not a single
Templar escaped.</p>

<p>De Tremelay was succeeded (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1154) by Brother Bertrand
de Blanquefort, a knight of a noble family of Guienne, called
by William of Tyre a pious and God-fearing man. On Tuesday,
June 19, <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1156, the Templars were drawn into an ambuscade
whilst marching with Baldwin, king of Jerusalem, near Tiberias,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
three hundred of the brethren were slain on the field of battle,
and eighty-seven fell into the hands of the enemy, among whom
was Bertrand de Blanquefort himself, and Brother Odo, marshal
of the kingdom. Shortly afterwards, a small band of them captured
a large detachment of Saracens; and in a night attack on
the camp of Noureddin, they compelled that famous chieftain to
fly, without arms and half-naked, from the field of battle. In
this last affair the name of Robert Mansel, an Englishman, and
Gilbert de Lacy, preceptor of the Temple of Tripoli, are honourably
mentioned.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>The fiery zeal and warlike enthusiasm of the Templars were
equalled, if not surpassed, by the stern fanaticism and religious
ardour of the followers of Mahomet. “Noureddin fought,” says
his oriental biographer, “like the meanest of his soldiers, saying,
‘Alas! it is now a long time that I have been seeking
martyrdom without being able to obtain it.’ The Imaum Koteb-ed-din,
hearing him on one occasion utter these words, exclaimed,
‘In the name of God do not put your life in danger,
do not thus expose Islam and the Moslems. Thou art their
stay and support, and if (but God preserve us therefrom) thou
shouldest be slain, we are all undone.’ ‘Ah! Koteb-ed-deen,’
said he, ‘what hast thou said, who can save <i>Islam</i> and our country,
but that great God who has no equal?’ ‘What,’ said he, on
another occasion, ‘do we not look to the security of our houses
against robbers and plunderers, and shall we not defend <span class="small">RELIGION</span>?’”<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
Like the Templars, Noureddin fought constantly with
spiritual and with carnal weapons. He resisted the world and
its temptations, by fasting and prayer, and by the daily exercise
of the moral and religious duties and virtues inculcated in the
Koran. He fought with the sword against the foes of Islam, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
employed his whole energies, to the last hour of his life in the
enthusiastic and fanatic struggle for the recovery of Jerusalem.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
In his camp, all profane and frivolous conversation was severely
prohibited; the exercises of religion were assiduously practised,
and the intervals of action were employed in prayer, meditation,
and the study of the Koran. “The sword,” says the prophet
Mahomet, in that remarkable book, “is the key of heaven and
of hell; a drop of blood shed in the cause of God, a night spent
in arms, is of more avail than two months of fasting and of
prayer. Whosoever falls in battle, his sins are forgiven him.
At the day of judgment his wounds will be resplendent as vermillion,
and odoriferous as musk, and the loss of limbs shall be
supplied by the wings of angels and cherubims.”</p>

<p>Among the many instances of the fanatical ardour of the
Moslem warriors, are the following, extracted from the history
of <i>Abu Abdollah Alwakidi</i>, Cadi of Bagdad. “Methinks,” said a
valiant Saracen youth, in the heat of battle&mdash;“methinks I see
the black-eyed girls looking upon me, one of whom, should she
appear in this world, all mankind would die for love of her; and
I see in the hand of one of them a handkerchief of green
silk, and a cap made of precious stones, and she beckons me,
and calls out, Come hither quickly, for I love thee.” With these
words, charging the Christian host, he made havoc wherever he
went, until at last he was struck down by a javelin. “It is not,”
said another dying Arabian warrior, when he embraced for the last
time his sister and mother&mdash;“it is not the fading pleasure of this
world that has prompted me to devote my life in the cause of
<span class="small">RELIGION</span>, I seek the favour of <span class="smcap">God</span> and his <span class="small">APOSTLE</span>, and I have
heard from one of the companions of the prophet, that the spirits
of the martyrs will be lodged in the crops of green birds who
taste the fruits and drink of the waters of paradise. Farewell:
we shall meet again among the groves and fountains which God
has prepared for his elect.”<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>The Master of the Temple, Brother Bertrand de Blanquefort,
was liberated from captivity at the instance of Manuel Comnenus,
Emperor of Constantinople. After his release, he wrote
several letters to Louis VII., king of France, describing the condition
and prospects of the Holy Land: the increasing power
and boldness of the infidels; and the ruin and desolation caused
by a dreadful earthquake, which had overthrown numerous
castles, prostrated the walls and defences of several towns, and
swallowed up the dwellings of the inhabitants. “The persecutors
of the church,” says he, “hasten to avail themselves of our
misfortunes; they gather themselves together from the ends of
the earth, and come forth as one man against the sanctuary of
God.”</p>

<p>It was during his mastership, that Geoffrey, the Knight
Templar, and Hugh of Cæsarea, were sent on an embassy into
Egypt, and had their famous interview with the Caliph. They
were introduced into the palace of the Fatimites through a series
of gloomy passages and glittering porticos, amid the warbling of
birds and the murmur of fountains; the scene was enriched by
a display of costly furniture and rare animals; and the long
order of unfolding doors was guarded by black soldiers and
domestic eunuchs. The sanctuary of the presence chamber was
veiled with a curtain, and the vizier who conducted the ambassadors
laid aside his scimitar, and prostrated himself three times
on the ground; the veil was then removed, and they saw the
Commander of the Faithful.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Brother Bertrand de Blanquefort, in his letters to the king of
France, gives an account of the military operations undertaken
by the order of the Temple in Egypt, and of the capture of the
populous and important city of Belbeis, the ancient Pelusium.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
During the absence of the Master with the greater part of the
fraternity on that expedition, the sultan Noureddin invaded Pa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>lestine;
he defeated with terrible slaughter the serving brethren
and Turcopoles, or light horse of the order, who remained to defend
the country, and sixty of the knights who commanded them
were left dead on the plain. Amalric, king of Jerusalem, the
successor of Baldwin the Third, in a letter “to his dear friend
and father,” Louis the Seventh, king of France, beseeches the
good offices of that monarch in behalf of all the devout
Christians of the Holy Land; “but above all,” says he, “we
earnestly entreat your Majesty constantly to extend to the utmost
your favour and regard to the Brothers of the Temple, who continually
render up their lives for God and the faith, and through
whom we do the little that we are able to effect, for in them indeed,
after God, is placed the entire reliance of all those in the
eastern regions who tread in the right path.”<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The Master,
Brother Bertrand de Blanquefort, was succeeded, (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1167,) by
Philip of Naplous, the first Master of the Temple who had been
born in Palestine. He had been Lord of the fortresses of Krak
and Montreal in Arabia Petræa, and took the vows and the
habit of the order of the Temple after the death of his wife.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>We must now pause to take a glance at the rise of another great
religio-military institution which, from henceforth, takes a leading
part in the defence of the Latin kingdom. In the eleventh
century, when pilgrimages to Jerusalem had greatly increased,
some Italian merchants of Amalfi, who carried on a lucrative
trade with Palestine, purchased of the Caliph <i>Monstasserbillah</i>,
a piece of ground in the Christian quarter of the Holy City, near
the church of the Resurrection, whereon two hospitals were constructed,
the one being appropriated for the reception of male
pilgrims, and the other for females. Several pious and charitable
Christians, chiefly from Europe, devoted themselves in these
hospitals to constant attendance upon the sick and destitute.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Two chapels were erected, the one annexed to the female establishment
being dedicated to St. Mary Magdalene, and the other
to St. John the Eleemosynary, a canonized patriarch of Alexandria,
remarkable for his exceeding charity. The pious and kind-hearted
people who here attended upon the sick pilgrims, clothed
the naked and fed the hungry, were called “The Hospitallers of
St. John.” On the conquest of Jerusalem by the Crusaders,
these charitable persons were naturally regarded with the greatest
esteem and reverence by their fellow-christians from the west;
many of the soldiers of the cross, smitten with their piety and
zeal, desired to participate in their good offices, and the Hospitallers,
animated by the religious enthusiasm of the day, determined
to renounce the world, and devote the remainder of their
lives to pious duties and constant attendance upon the sick.
They took the customary monastic vows of obedience, chastity,
and poverty, and assumed as their distinguishing habit a <i>black</i>
mantle with a <i>white</i> cross on the breast. Various lands and possessions
were granted them by the lords and princes of the
Crusade, both in Palestine and in Europe, and the order of the
hospital of St. John speedily became a great and powerful institution.</p>

<p>Gerard, a native of Provence, was at this period at the head of
the society, with the title of “Guardian of the Poor.” He was
succeeded (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1118) by Raymond Dupuy, a knight of Dauphiné,
who drew up a series of rules for the direction and government
of his brethren. In these rules no traces are discoverable of the
military spirit which afterwards animated the order of the Hospital
of St. John. The first authentic notice of an intention on
the part of the Hospitallers to occupy themselves with military
matters, occurs in the bull of Pope Innocent the Second, dated
<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1130. This bull is addressed to the archbishops, bishops,
and clergy of the church universal, and informs them that the
Hospitallers then retained, at their own expense, a body of
horsemen and foot soldiers, to defend the pilgrims in going to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
and returning from the holy places; the pope observes that the
funds of the hospital were insufficient to enable them effectually
to fulfil the pious and holy task, and he exhorts the archbishops,
bishops, and clergy, to minister to the necessities of the order
out of their abundant property. The Hospitallers consequently
at this period had resolved to add the task of <i>protecting</i> to that of
tending and relieving pilgrims.</p>

<p>After the accession (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1168) of Gilbert d’Assalit to the
guardianship of the Hospital&mdash;a man described by De Vertot as
“bold and enterprising, and of an extravagant genius”&mdash;a military
spirit was infused into the Hospitallers, which speedily predominated
over their pious and charitable zeal in attending upon
the poor and the sick. Gilbert d’Assalit was the friend and confidant
of Amalric, king of Jerusalem, and planned with that
monarch a wicked invasion of Egypt in defiance of treaties.
The Master of the Temple being consulted concerning the expedition,
flatly refused to have anything to do with it, or to allow
a single brother of the order of the Temple to accompany the
king in arms: “For it appeared a hard matter to the Templars,”
says William of Tyre, “to wage war without cause, in defiance
of treaties, and against all honour and conscience, upon a friendly
nation, preserving faith with us, and relying on our own faith.”
Gilbert d’Assalit consequently determined to obtain for the king
from his own brethren that aid which the Templars denied; and
to tempt the Hospitallers to arm themselves generally as a great
military society, in imitation of the Templars, and join the expedition
to Egypt, Gilbert d’Assalit was authorised to promise
them in the name of the king, the possession of the wealthy and
important city of Belbeis, the ancient Pelusium, in perpetual
sovereignty.</p>

<p>According to De Vertot, the senior Hospitallers were greatly
averse to the military projects of their chief: “They urged,”
says he, “that they were a religious order, and that the church
had not put arms into their hands to make conquests;” but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
younger and more ardent of the brethren, burning to exchange
the monotonous life of the cloister for the enterprise and activity
of the camp, received the proposals of their superior with enthusiasm,
and a majority of the chapter decided in favour of the
plans and projects of their Guardian. They authorised him to
borrow money of the Florentine and Genoese merchants, to take
hired soldiers into the pay of the order, and to organize the
Hospitallers as a great military society.</p>

<p>It was in the first year of the government of Philip of Naplous
(<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1168) that the king of Jerusalem and the Hospitallers
marched forth upon their memorable and unfortunate expedition.
The Egyptians were taken completely by surprise; the city of
Belbeis was carried by assault, and the defenceless inhabitants
were barbarously massacred. The cruelty and the injustice of
the Christians, however, speedily met with condign punishment.
The king of Jerusalem was driven back into Palestine; Belbeis
was abandoned with precipitation; and the Hospitallers fled
before the infidels in sorrow and disappointment to Jerusalem.
There they vented their indignation and chagrin upon the unfortunate
Gilbert d’Assalit, their superior, who had got the order
into debt to the extent of 100,000 pieces of gold; they compelled
him to resign his authority, and the unfortunate guardian of the
hospital fled from Palestine to England, and was drowned in the
Channel. From this period, however, the character of the order
of the Hospital of St. John was entirely changed: the Hospitallers
appear henceforth as a great military body; their superior
styles himself Master, and leads in person the brethren into the
field of battle. Attendance upon the poor and the sick still continued,
indeed, one of the duties of the fraternity, but it must
have been feebly exercised amid the clash of arms and the excitement
of war.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>The Grand Master of the Temple, Philip of Naplous, resigned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
his authority after a short government of three years, and was
succeeded (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1170) by Brother Odo de St. Amand, a proud
and fiery warrior, of undaunted courage and resolution; having,
according to William, Archbishop of Tyre, the fear neither of
God nor of man before his eyes.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> It was during his Grand
Mastership (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1172) that the Knight Templar Walter du
Mesnil slew an envoy or minister of the assassins. These were
an odious religious sect, settled in the fastnesses of the mountains
above Tripoli, and supposed to be descended from the Ismaelians
of Persia. They devoted their souls and bodies in
blind obedience to a chief who is called by the writers of the
Crusades “the old man of the mountain,” and were employed
by him in the most extensive system of murder and assassination
known in the history of the world. Both Christian and
Moslem writers enumerate with horror the many illustrious
victims that fell beneath their daggers. They assumed all shapes
and disguises for the furtherance of their deadly designs, and
carried, in general, no arms except a small poniard concealed in
the folds of their dress, called in the Persian tongue <i>hassissin</i>,
whence these wretches were called <i>assassins</i>, their chief the prince
of the assassins; and the word itself, in all its odious import,
has passed into most European languages.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Raimond, son of the count of Tripoli, had been slain by these
fanatics whilst kneeling at the foot of the altar in the church of
the Blessed Virgin at Carchusa or Tortosa; the Templars flew
to arms to avenge his death; they penetrated into the fastnesses
and strongholds of “the mountain chief,” and at last compelled
him to purchase peace by the payment of an annual tribute of
two thousand crowns into the treasury of the order. In the
ninth year of Amalric’s reign, <i>Sinan Ben Suleiman</i>, imaun of
the assassins, sent a trusty counsellor to Jerusalem, offering, in
the name of himself and his people, to embrace the christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
religion, provided the Templars would release them from the tribute
money. The proposition was favourably received; the
envoy was honourably entertained for some days, and on his departure
he was furnished by the king with a guide and an escort
to conduct him in safety to the frontier. The Ismaelite had
reached the borders of the Latin kingdom, and was almost in
sight of the castles of his brethren, when he was slain by the
Knight Templar Walter du Mesnil, who attacked the escort with
a body of armed followers. The king of Jerusalem assembled
the barons of the kingdom at Sidon to determine on the best
means of obtaining satisfaction for the injury; and it was determined
that two of their number should proceed to Odo de St.
Amand to demand the surrender of the criminal. The haughty
Master of the Temple bade them inform his majesty the king,
that the members of the order were not subject to his jurisdiction,
nor to that of his officers; that the Templars acknowledged
no earthly superior except the pope; and that to the holy pontiff
alone belonged the cognizance of the offence. He declared,
however, that the crime should meet with due punishment: that
he had caused the criminal to be arrested and put in irons, and
would forthwith send him to Rome, but till judgment was given
in his case, he forbade all persons of whatsoever degree to meddle
with him.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>The Templars were now destined to meet with a more formidable
opponent than any they had hitherto encountered in
the field, one who was again to cause the <i>crescent</i> to triumph
over the <span class="small">CROSS</span>, and to plant the standard of the prophet upon
the walls of the holy city. When the Fatimite caliph had received
intelligence of king Amalric’s invasion of Egypt, (ante
<a href="#Page_36">p. 36</a>) he sent the hair of his women, one of the greatest tokens
of distress known in the East, to the pious Noureddin, who immediately
despatched a body of troops to his assistance, headed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
by Sheerkoh, and his nephew, <i>Youseef-Ben-Acoub-Ben-Schadi</i> the
famous Saladin. Sheerkoh died immediately after his arrival,
and Youseef succeeded to his command, and was appointed vizier
of the caliph. He had passed his youth in pleasure and debauchery,
sloth and indolence, but as soon as he grasped the
power of the sword, and obtained the command of armies, he
renounced the pleasures of the world, and assumed the character
of a saint. His dress was a coarse-woollen garment; water was
his only drink; and he carefully abstained from everything disapproved
of by the Mussulman religion. Five times each day
he prostrated himself in public prayer, surrounded by his friends
and followers, and his demeanour became grave, serious, and
thoughtful. His nights were often spent in watching and meditation,
he was diligent in fasting and in the study of the Koran,
and his admiring brethren gave him the name of <i>Salah-ed-deen</i>,
“Integrity of Religion,” vulgarly called Saladin.</p>

<p>Having aroused the religious enthusiasm of the Moslems he
proceeded to take vengeance upon the Christians for their perfidious
invasion of Egypt. He assembled an army of forty thousand
horse and foot, crossed the desert and besieged the fortified
city of Gaza, which belonged to the Knights Templars, and was
considered to be the key of Palestine towards Egypt. The luxuriant
gardens, the palm and olive groves of this city of the wilderness
were destroyed by the wild cavalry of the desert, and
the innumerable tents of the Arab host were thickly clustered
on the neighbouring sand-hills. The warlike monks of the
Temple in their turn fasted and prayed, and invoked the aid of
the God of battles; they made a desperate defence, and in an
unexpected sally upon the enemy’s camp, they performed such
prodigies of valour, that Saladin, despairing of being able to
take the place, abandoned the siege, and retired into Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>On the death of Noureddin, sultan of Damascus, (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1175,)
Saladin raised himself to the sovereignty both of Egypt and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
Syria. He again levied an immense army, crossed the desert,
and planted the standard of Mahomet upon the sacred territory
of Palestine. His forces were composed of twenty-six thousand
light infantry, eight thousand horsemen, a host of archers and
spearmen mounted on dromedaries, eighteen thousand common
soldiers, and a body-guard of a thousand Mamlook emirs, clothed
in yellow cloaks, worn over their shirts of mail. In the great
battle fought near Ascalon, (Nov. 1, <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1177,) Odo de St.
Amand, the Master of the Temple, at the head of eighty
of his knights, broke through the guard of Mamlooks, slew
their commander, and penetrated to the imperial tent, from
whence Saladin escaped with great difficulty, almost naked, upon
a fleet dromedary. The year following, the Templars, in order
to protect and cover the road leading from Damascus to Jerusalem,
commenced the erection of a strong fortress on the northern
frontier of the Latin kingdom, close to Jacob’s ford on the river
Jordan, at the spot where now stands <i>Djiss’r Beni Yakoob</i>, “the
bridge of the sons of Jacob.” Saladin advanced at the head of
his forces to oppose the progress of the work, and the king of
Jerusalem and all the chivalry of the Latin kingdom were gathered
together in the plain to protect the Templars and their
workmen. In a general action the entire army of the cross was
defeated with immense slaughter. The Templars and the Hospitallers,
with the count of Tripoli, stood firm on the summit of
a small hillock, and for a long time presented a bold and undaunted
front to the victorious enemy. The count of Tripoli at
last cut his way through the infidels, and fled to Tyre; the Master
of the Hospital, after seeing most of his brethren slain, swam
across the Jordan, and fled, covered with wounds, to the castle of
Beaufort; and the Templars after fighting with their accustomed
zeal and fanaticism around the red-cross banner, which waved to
the last over the field of blood, were all killed or taken prisoners,
and the Master, Odo de St. Amand, fell alive into the
hands of the enemy. Saladin then laid siege to the newly-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>erected
fortress, which was defended by thick walls, flanked with
large towers furnished with military engines, and after a gallant
resistance on the part of the garrison, it was set on fire, and then
stormed. “The Templars,” says Abulpharadge, “flung themselves
some into the fire, where they were burned, some cast
themselves into the Jordan, some jumped down from the walls
on to the rocks, and were dashed to pieces: thus were slain the
enemy.” The fortress was reduced to a heap of ruins, and the
enraged sultan, it is said, ordered all the Templars taken in the
place to be sawn in two, excepting the most distinguished of
the knights, who were reserved for a ransom, and were sent in
chains to Aleppo. Saladin offered Odo de St. Amand his liberty
in exchange for the freedom of his own nephew, who was a
prisoner in the hands of the Templars; but the Master of the
Temple haughtily replied, that he would never, by his example,
encourage any of his knights to be mean enough to surrender,
that a Templar ought either to vanquish or die, and that he had
nothing to give for his ransom but his girdle and his knife. The
proud spirit of Odo de St. Amand could but ill brook confinement;
he languished and died in the dungeons of Damascus,
and was succeeded (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1180) by Brother Arnold de Torroge,
who had filled some of the chief situations of the order in
Europe.</p>

<p>The affairs of the Latin Christians were at this period in a
deplorable situation. Saladin encamped near Tiberias, and extended
his ravages into almost every part of Palestine. His light
cavalry swept the valley of the Jordan to within a day’s march of
Jerusalem, and the whole country as far as Panias on the one
side, and Beisan, D’Jeneen, and Sebaste, on the other, was destroyed
by fire and the sword. The houses of the Templars were
pillaged and burnt; various castles belonging to the order were
taken by assault; but the immediate destruction of the Latin
power was arrested by some partial successes obtained by the
Christian warriors, and by the skilful generalship of their leaders.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
Saladin was compelled to retreat to Damascus, after he had burnt
Naplous, and depopulated the whole country around Tiberias.
A truce was proposed, (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1184,) and as the attention of the
sultan was then distracted by the intrigues of the Turcoman
chieftains in the north of Syria, and he was again engaged in
hostilities in Mesopotamia, he agreed to a suspension of the war
for four years, in consideration of the payment by the Christians
of a large sum of money.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Immediate advantage was taken of this truce to secure the
safety of the Latin kingdom. A grand council was called together
at Jerusalem, and it was determined that Heraclius, the patriarch
of the Holy City, and the Masters of the Temple and
Hospital, should forthwith proceed to Europe, to obtain succour
from the western princes. The sovereign mostly depended upon
for assistance was Henry the Second, king of England, grandson
of Fulk, the late king of Jerusalem, and cousin-german to Baldwin,
the then reigning sovereign. Henry had received absolution
for the murder of Saint Thomas à Becket, on condition that
he should proceed in person at the head of a powerful army to
the succour of Palestine, and should, at his own expense, maintain
two hundred Templars for the defence of the holy territory.
The patriarch and the two Masters landed in Italy, and after
furnishing themselves with the letters of the pope, threatening
the English monarch with the judgments of heaven if he did
not forthwith perform the penance prescribed him, they set out
for England. At Verona, the Master of the Temple fell sick
and died, but his companions proceeding on their journey, landed
in safety in England at the commencement of the year 1185.
They were received by the king at Reading, and throwing themselves
at the feet of the English monarch, they with much weeping
and sobbing saluted him in behalf of the king, the princes,
and the people of the kingdom of Jerusalem. They explained
the object of their visit, and presented him with the pope’s letters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
with the keys of the holy sepulchre, of the tower of David,
and of the city of Jerusalem, together with the royal banner of
the Latin kingdom. Their eloquent and pathetic narrative of the
fierce inroads of Saladin, and of the miserable condition of Palestine,
drew tears from king Henry and all his court. The
English sovereign gave encouraging assurances to the patriarch
and his companions, and promised to bring the whole matter
before the parliament, which was to meet the first Sunday in
Lent.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>The patriarch, in the mean time, proceeded to London, and
was received by the Knights Templars at the Temple in that
city, the chief house of the order in Britain, where, in the month
of February, he consecrated the beautiful Temple church, dedicated
to the blessed Virgin Mary, which had just then been
erected.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p class="i12"><i>Chron.</i> à la suite du Roman de Favel.
</p></div></div>

<p class="p2">The Knights Templars first established the chief house of
their order in England, without Holborn Bars, on the south side
of the street, where Southampton House formerly stood, adjoining
to which Southampton Buildings were afterwards erected:
and it is stated, that about a century and a half ago, part of the
ancient chapel annexed to this establishment, of a circular form,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
and built of Caen stone, was discovered on pulling down some
old houses near Southampton Buildings in Chancery Lane.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
This first house of the Temple, established by Hugh de Payens
himself, before his departure from England, on his return to
Palestine, was adapted to the wants and necessities of the order
in its infant state, when the knights, instead of lingering in the
preceptories of Europe, proceeded at once to Palestine, and when
all the resources of the society were strictly and faithfully forwarded
to Jerusalem, to be expended in defence of the faith;
but when the order had greatly increased in numbers, power,
and wealth, and had somewhat departed from its original purity
and simplicity, we find that the superior and the knights resident
in London began to look abroad for a more extensive and
commodious place of habitation. They purchased a large space
of ground, extending from the White Friars westward to Essex
House without Temple Bar, and commenced the erection of a
convent on a scale of grandeur commensurate with the dignity
and importance of the chief house of the great religio-military
society of the Temple in Britain. It was called the <i>New</i> Temple, to
distinguish it from the original establishment at Holborn, which
came thenceforth to be known by the name of the <i>Old</i> Temple.
This New Temple was adapted for the residence of numerous
military monks and novices, serving brothers, retainers, and domestics.
It contained the residence of the superior and of the
knights, the cells and apartments of the chaplains and serving
brethren, the council chamber where the chapters were held, and
the refectory or dining-hall, which was connected, by a range of
handsome cloisters, with the magnificent church, consecrated by
the patriarch. Alongside the river extended a spacious pleasure
ground for the recreation of the brethren, who were not permitted
to go into the town without the leave of the Master. It was used
also for military exercises and the training of horses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>The year of the consecration of the Temple Church, Geoffrey,
the superior of the order in England, caused an inquisition to be
made of the lands of the Templars in this country, and the names
of the donors thereof,<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> from which it appears, that the larger territorial
divisions of the order were then called bailiwicks, the principal
of which were London, Warwic, Couele, Meritune, Gutinge,
Westune, Lincolnscire, Lindeseie, Widine, and Eboracisire
(Yorkshire). The number of manors, farms, churches, advowsons,
demesne lands, villages, hamlets, windmills, and watermills,
rents of assize, rights of common and free warren, and the
amount of all kinds of property possessed by the Templars in
England at the period of the taking of this inquisition, are astonishing.
Upon the great estates belonging to the order, prioral
houses had been erected, wherein dwelt the procurators or
stewards charged with the management of the manors and farms
in their neighbourhood, and with the collection of the rents.
These prioral houses became regular monastic establishments,
inhabited chiefly by sick and aged Templars, who retired to
them to spend the remainder of their days, after a long period
of honourable service against the infidels in Palestine. They
were cells to the principal house at London. There were also
under them certain smaller administrations established for the
management of the farms, consisting of a Knight Templar, to
whom were associated some serving brothers of the order, and a
priest who acted as almoner. The commissions or mandates
directed by the Master of the Temple to the officers at the head
of these establishments were called precepts, from the commencement
of them, “<i>Præcipimus tibi</i>,” we enjoin or direct you, &amp;c. &amp;c.
The knights to whom they were addressed were styled <i>Præceptores
Templi</i>, or Preceptors of the Temple, and the districts
administered by them <i>Præceptoria</i>, or preceptories.</p>

<p>It will now be as well to take a general survey of the possessions
and organization of the order both in Europe and Asia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a><br /><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a><br /><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
“whose circumstances,” saith William, archbishop of Tyre, writing
from Jerusalem about the period of the consecration at
London of the Temple Church, “are in so flourishing a state,
that at this day they have in their convent (the Temple on
Mount Moriah) more than three hundred knights robed in the
white habit, besides serving brothers innumerable. Their possessions
indeed beyond the sea, as well as in these parts, are
said to be so vast, that there cannot now be a province in Christendom
which does not contribute to the support of the aforesaid
brethren, whose wealth is said to equal that of sovereign
princes.”<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>The eastern provinces of the order were, 1. Palestine, the
ruling province. 2. The principality of Antioch. 3. The principality
of Tripoli. In Palestine the Templars possessed, in
addition to the Temple at Jerusalem, the chief house of the
order, and the residence of the Master, the fortified city of
Gaza, the key of the kingdom of Jerusalem on the side next
Egypt, which was granted to them in perpetual sovereignty, by
Baldwin king of Jerusalem; also the Castle of Saphet, in the
territory of the ancient tribe of Naphtali; the Castle of the Pilgrims,
in the neighbourhood of Mount Carmel; the Castle of
Assur near Jaffa, and the house of the Temple at Jaffa; the fortress
of Faba, or La Feue, the ancient Aphek, not far from Tyre,
in the territory of the ancient tribe of Asher; the hill-fort Dok
between Bethel and Jericho; the castles of La Cave, Marle,
Citern Rouge, Castel Blanc, Trapesach, Sommelleria of the Temple,
in the neighbourhood of Acca, now St. John d’Acre;
Castrum Planorum, and a place called Gerinum Parvum.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The
Templars, moreover, purchased the castle of Beaufort and the
city of Sidon; they also got into their hands a great part of the
town of St. Jean d’Acre, where they erected a famous <span class="small">TEMPLE</span>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
and almost all the sea coast of Palestine was in the end divided
between them and the Hospitallers of St. John. The principal
houses of the Temple in the <span class="smcap">Province of Antioch</span> were at Antioch
itself, at Aleppo, and Haram; and in the <span class="smcap">Principality of
Tripoli</span>, at Tripoli, Tortosa, the ancient Antaradus; Castel
Blanc in the same neighbourhood; Laodicea and Beyrout.</p>

<p>In the western province of <span class="smcap">Apulia and Sicily</span>, the Templars
possessed numerous houses, viz., at Palermo, Syracuse, Lentini,
Butera, and Trapani. The house of the Temple at this last
place has been appropriated to the use of some monks of the
order of St. Augustin. In a church of the city is still to be seen
the celebrated statue of the Virgin, which Brother Guerrege and
three other Knights Templars brought from the East, with a
view of placing it in the Temple Church on the Aventine hill in
Rome, but which they were obliged to deposit in the island of
Sicily. This statue is of the most beautiful white marble, and
represents the Virgin with the infant Jesus reclining on her left
arm; it is of about the natural height, and, from an inscription
on the foot of the figure, it appears to have been executed by a
native of the island of Cyprus, <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 733. The Templars possessed
valuable estates in Sicily, around the base of Mount
Etna, and large tracts of land between Piazza and Calatagirone,
in the suburbs of which last place there was a Temple house,
the church whereof, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, still remains.
They possessed also many churches in the island, windmills,
rights of fishery, of pasturage, of cutting wood in the forests, and
many important privileges and immunities. The chief house
was at Messina, where the Grand Prior resided.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Upper and Central Italy</span> also contained numerous preceptories
of the order of the Temple, all under the immediate
superintendence of the grand Prior or Preceptor of Rome.
There were large establishments at Lucca, Milan, and Perugia,
at which last place the arms of the Temple are still to be seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
on the tower of the holy cross. At Placentia there was a magnificent
and extensive convent, called Santa Maria del Tempio,
ornamented with a very lofty tower. At Bologna there was also a
large Temple house, and on a clock in the city is the following inscription,
“<i>Magister Tosseolus de Miolâ me fecit ... Fr. Petrus
de Bon, Procur. Militiæ Templi in curiâ Romanâ</i>, <span class="small">MCCCIII</span>.” In the
church of St. Mary in the same place, which formerly belonged
to the Knights Templars, is the interesting marble monument
of Peter de Rotis, a priest of the order.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Province of Portugal</span>, the military power and resources
of the order were exercised in almost constant warfare
against the Moors, and Europe derived essential advantage from
the enthusiastic exertions of the warlike monks in that quarter
against the infidels. In every battle, indeed, fought in the
south of Europe, after the year 1130, against the enemies of the
cross, the Knights Templars are to be found taking an active
and distinguished part. They were extremely popular with all
the princes and sovereigns of the great Spanish peninsula, and
were endowed with cities, villages, lordships, and splendid
domains. The Grand Prior or Preceptor of Portugal resided at
the castle of Tomar. It is seated on the river Narboan, in Estremadura,
and is still to be seen towering in gloomy magnificence
on the hill above the town. The castle at present belongs
to the order of Christ, and was lately one of the grandest and
richest establishments in Portugal. It possessed a splendid
library, and a handsome cloister, the architecture of which was
much admired. The houses or preceptories of the Temple in
the province of Castile and Leon were those of Cuenca, and
Guadalfagiara; Tine and Aviles in the diocese of Oviedo, and
Pontevreda in Galicia. In Castile alone the order is said to
have possessed twenty-four bailiwicks.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Aragon</span> the Templars possessed the castles of Dumbel,
Cabanos, Azuda, Granena, Chalonere, Remolins, Corbins, Lo
Mas de Barbaran, Moncon, and Montgausi, with their territories<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
and dependencies. They were lords of the cities of Borgia and
Tortosa; they had a tenth part of the revenues of the kingdom,
the taxes of the towns of Huesca and Saragossa, and houses,
possessions, privileges, and immunities in all parts.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> They possessed
likewise lands and estates in the Balearic Isles, which
were under the management of the Prior or Preceptor of the
island of Majorca, who was subject to the Grand Preceptor of
Aragon.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Germany and Hungary</span> the houses and preceptories most
known were at Homburg, Assenheim, Rotgen in the Rhingau,
Mongberg in the Marché of Brandenbourg, Nuitz on the Rhine,
Tissia Altmunmunster near Ratisbon in Bavaria, Bamberg, Middleburgh,
Hall, and Brunswick. The Templars possessed the fiefs
of Rorich, Pausin and Wildenheuh in <i>Pomerania</i>, an establishment
at Bach in <i>Hungary</i>, several lordships in <i>Bohemia</i> and
<i>Moravia</i>, and lands, tithes, and large revenues, the gifts of pious
German crusaders.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> In <span class="smcap">Greece</span> the Templars also possessed
lands and establishments. Their chief house was at Constantinople,
in the quarter called Ὁμόνοια, where they had an oratory
dedicated to the holy martyrs Marin and Pentaleon.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> In <span class="smcap">France</span>
the principal preceptories were at Besançon, Dole, Salins, à la
Romagne, à la ville Dieu, Arbois in <i>Franche Comté</i>. Dorlesheim
near Molsheim, where their still remains a chapel called Templehoff,
Fauverney, where a chapel dedicated to the Virgin still
preserves the name of the Temple, Des Feuilles, situate in the
parish of Villett, near the chateau de Vernay, and Rouen, where
there were two houses of the Temple; one of them occupied the
site of the present <i>maison consulaire</i>, and the other stood in the
street now called <i>La Rue des Hermites</i>. The preceptories and
houses of the Temple in France, indeed, were so numerous, that
it would be a wearisome and endless task to repeat the names of
them. Between Joinville and St. Dizier may still be seen the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
remains of Temple Ruet, an old chateau surrounded by a moat;
and in the diocese of Meaux are the ruins of the great manorial
house of Choisy le Temple. Many interesting tombs are there
visible, together with the refectory of the knights, which has
been converted into a sheepfold. The chief house of the order
for France, and also for Holland and the Netherlands, was the
Temple at Paris, an extensive and magnificent structure, surrounded
by a wall and a ditch. It extended over all that large
space of ground, now covered with streets and buildings, which
lies between the Rue du Temple, the Rue St. Croix, and the environs
de la Verrerie, as far as the walls and the fossés of the
port du Temple. It was ornamented with a great tower, flanked
by four smaller towers, erected by the Knight Templar Brother
Herbert, almoner to the king of France, and was one of the
strongest edifices in the kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Many of the modern streets
of Paris which now traverse the site of this interesting structure,
preserve in the names given to them some memorial of the
ancient Temple. For instance, <i>La rue du Temple</i>, <i>La rue des
fossés du Temple</i>, <i>Boulevard du Temple</i>, <i>Faubourg du Temple</i>, <i>rue de
Faubourg du Temple</i>, <i>Vieille rue du Temple</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

</div>

<p>All the houses of the Temple in Holland and the Netherlands
were under the immediate jurisdiction of the Master of the
Temple at Paris. The preceptories in these kingdoms were
very numerous, and the property dependent upon them was of
great value.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">England</span> there were in bygone times the preceptories of
Aslakeby, Temple Bruere, Egle, Malteby, Mere, Wilketon, and
Witham, in <i>Lincolnshire</i>. North Feriby, Temple Hurst, Temple

and Dunwich, in <i>Suffolk</i>.</p>

<p>There were also several smaller administrations established,
as before mentioned, for the management of the farms and lands,
and the collection of rent and tithes. Among these were Liddele
and Quiely in the diocese of Chichester; Eken in the
diocese of Lincoln; Adingdon, Wesdall, Aupledina, Cotona, &amp;c.
The different preceptors of the Temple in England had under their
management lands and property in every county of the realm.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>In <i>Leicestershire</i> the Templars possessed the town and the

Stonesby, and Melton; Rothely wood, near Leicester; the villages
of Beaumont, Baresby, Dalby, North and South Mardefeld,

They had also the churches of Rotheley, Babbegrave, and Rolle;
and the chapels of Gaddesby, Grimston, Wartnaby, Cawdwell,
and Wykeham.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

had the manors of Temple Cressynge, Temple Roydon, Temple
Sutton, Odewell, Chingelford, Lideleye, Quarsing, Berwick, and
Witham; the church of Roydon, and houses, lands, and farms,
both at Roydon, at Rivenhall, and in the parishes of Prittlewall
and Great and Little Sutton; an old mansion-house and chapel
at Sutton, and an estate called Finchinfelde in the hundred of
Hinckford.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> In <i>Lincolnshire</i> the Templars possessed the manors
of La Bruere, Roston, Kirkeby, Brauncewell, Carleton,
Akele, with the soke of Lynderby, Aslakeby, and the churches
of Bruere, Asheby, Akele, Aslakeby, Donington, Ele, Swinderby,
Skarle, &amp;c. There were upwards of thirty churches in the
county which made annual payments, to the order of the
Temple, and about forty windmills. The order likewise received
rents in respect of lands at Bracebrig, Brancestone, Scapwic,
Timberland, Weleburne, Diringhton, and a hundred other
places; and some of the land in the county was charged with
the annual payment of sums of money towards the keeping of
lights eternally burning on the altars of the Temple church.
William Lord of Asheby gave to the Templars the perpetual advowson
of the church of Asheby in Lincolnshire, and they in
return agreed to find him a priest to sing for ever twice a week
in his chapel of St. Margaret.</p>

<p>In <i>Yorkshire</i> the Templars possessed the manors of Temple
Werreby, Flaxflete, Etton, South Cave, &amp;c.; the churches of
Whitcherche Keluntune, &amp;c.; numerous windmills and lands and
rents at Nehus, Skelture, Pennel, and more than sixty other
places besides. In <i>Warwickshire</i> they possessed the manors of
Barston, Shirburne, Balshale, Wolfhey, Cherlecote, Herbebure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
Stodleye, Fechehampstead, Cobington, Tysho and Warwick;
lands at Chelverscoton, Herdwicke, Morton, Warwick, Hetherburn,
Chesterton, Aven, Derset, Stodley, Napton, and more than
thirty other places, the several donors whereof are specified in
Dugdale’s history of Warwickshire (p. 694) also the churches
of Sireburne, Cardington, &amp;c., and more than thirteen windmills.
In 12 Hen. II., William Earle of Warwick built a new church
for them at Warwick.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> In <i>Kent</i> they had the manors of Lilleston,
Hechewayton, Saunford, Sutton, Dartford, Halgel, Ewell, Cocklescomb,
Strode, Swinkfield Mennes, West Greenwich, and the manor
of Lydden, which now belongs to the archbishop of Canterbury;
the advowsons of the churches of West Greenwich and Kingeswode
juxta Waltham; extensive tracts of land in Romney marsh,
and farms and assize rents in all parts of the county. In <i>Sussex</i>
they had the manors of Saddlecomb and Shipley; lands and
tenements at Compton and other places; and the advowsons
of the churches of Shipley, Wodmancote, and Luschwyke.</p>

<p>In <i>Surrey</i> they had the manor farm of Temple Elfand or
Elfant, and an estate at Merrow in the hundred of Woking.
In <i>Gloucestershire</i>, the manors of Lower Dowdeswell, Pegsworth,
Amford, Nishange, and five others which belonged to them wholly
or in part, the church of Down Ammey, and lands in Frampton,
Temple Guting, and Little Rissington. In <i>Worcestershire</i>, the
manor of Templars Lawern, and lands in Flavel, Temple
Broughton, and Hanbury. In <i>Northamptonshire</i>, the manors of
Asheby, Thorp, Watervill, &amp;c., &amp;c.; they had the advowson of
the church of the manor of Hardwicke in Orlington hundred,
and we find that “Robert Saunford, Master of the soldiery of
the Temple in England,” presented to it in the year 1238.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> In
<i>Nottinghamshire</i>, the Templars possessed the church of Marnham,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
lands and rents at Gretton and North Carleton; in <i>Westmoreland</i>,
the manor of Temple Sowerby; in the Isle of Wight, the manor
of Uggeton, and lands in Kerne. But it would be tedious further
to continue with a dry detail of ancient names and places;
sufficient has been said to give an idea of the enormous wealth
of the order in this country, where it is known to have possessed
some hundreds of manors, the advowson or right of presentation
to churches innumerable, and thousands of acres of arable land,
pasture, and woodland, besides villages, farm-houses, mills, and
tithes, rights of common, of fishing, of cutting wood in forests,
&amp;c., &amp;c. There were also several preceptories in Scotland and
Ireland, which were dependent on the Temple at London.</p>

<p>The annual income of the order in Europe has been roughly
estimated at six millions sterling! According to Matthew Paris,
the Templars possessed <i>nine thousand</i> manors or lordships in
Christendom, besides a large revenue and immense riches arising
from the constant charitable bequests and donations of sums of
money from pious persons.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> The Templars, in imitation of the
other monastic establishments, obtained from pious and charitable
people all the advowsons within their reach, and frequently retained
the tithe and the glebe in their own hands, deputing a priest of
the order to perform divine service and administer the sacraments.
The manors of the Templars produced them rent either in
money, corn, or cattle, and the usual produce of the soil. By
the custom in some of these manors, the tenants were annually
to mow three days in harvest, one at the charge of the house,
and to plough three days, whereof one at the like charge; to
reap one day, at which time they should have a ram from the
house, eight pence, twenty-four loaves, and a cheese of the best
in the house, together with a pailful of drink. The tenants were
not to sell their horse-colts if they were foaled upon the land belonging
to the Templars, without the consent of the fraternity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
nor marry their daughters without their licence. There were
also various regulations concerning the cocks and hens and
young chickens.</p>

<p>King Henry the Second, for the good of his soul and the
welfare of his kingdom, granted the Templars a place situate on
the river Fleet, near Bainard’s Castle, with the whole current of
that river at London, for erecting a mill; also a messuage near
Fleet-street; the church of St. Clement, “quæ dicitur Dacorum
extra civitatem Londoniæ;” and the churches of Elle, Swinderby
and Skarle in Lincolnshire, Kingeswode juxta Waltham in Kent,
the manor of Stroder in the hundred of Skamele, the vill of Kele
in Staffordshire, the hermitage of Flikeamstede, and all his lands
at Lange Cureway, a house in Brosal, and the market at Witham;
lands at Berghotte, a mill at the bridge of Pembroke Castle, the
vill of Finchinfelde, the manor of Rotheley, with its appurtenances,
and the advowson of the church and its several chapels,
the manor of Blalcolvesley, the park of Halshall, and three <i>fat
bucks</i> annually, either from Essex or Windsor Forest. He likewise
granted them an annual fair at Temple Bruere, and superadded
many rich benefactions in Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>The Templars, in addition to their amazing wealth, enjoyed
vast privileges and immunities within this realm. They were
freed from all amerciaments in the Exchequer, and obtained the
privilege of not being compelled to plead except before the king
or his chief justice. By special grant from the kings of England,
they enjoyed free warren in all their demesne lands, also the power
of holding courts to judge their villains and vassals, and to try
thieves and malefactors; they were relieved from all the customary
feudal suits and services, from the works of parks, castles,
bridges, the building of royal houses, and all other works; and
also from waste regard and view of foresters, and from toll in all
markets and fairs, and at all bridges, and upon all highways
throughout the kingdom. They had also the chattels of felons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
and fugitives, and all waifs within their fee.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> In addition to the
particular privileges conceded to them by the kings of England,
the Templars enjoyed, under the authority of divers Papal bulls,
various immunities and advantages, which gave great umbrage
to the clergy. They were freed, as before mentioned, from the
obligation of paying tithes, and might, with the consent of the
bishop, receive them. No brother of the Temple could be excommunicated
by any bishop or priest, nor could any of the
churches of the order be laid under interdict except by virtue of
a special mandate from the holy see. When any brother of the
Temple, appointed to make charitable collections for the succour
of the Holy Land, should arrive at a city, castle, or village, which
had been laid under interdict, the churches, on their welcome
coming, were to be thrown open, (once within the year,) and
divine service was to be performed in honour of the Temple,
and in reverence for the holy soldiers thereof. The privilege of
sanctuary was thrown around their dwellings; and by various
papal bulls it is solemnly enjoined that no person shall lay violent
hands either upon the persons or the property of those flying
for refuge to the Temple houses.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>Sir Edward Coke, in the second part of the Institute of the
Laws of England, observes, that “the Templars did so overspread
throughout Christendome, and so exceedingly increased
in possessions, revenues, and wealth, and specially in England,
as you will wonder to reade in approved histories, and withall
obtained so great and large privileges, liberties, and immunities
for themselves, their tenants, and farmers, &amp;c., as no other order
had the like.” He further observes, that the Knights Templars
were <i>cruce signati</i>, and as the cross was the ensign of their profession,
and their tenants enjoyed great privileges, they did erect
crosses upon their houses, to the end that those inhabiting them
might be known to be the tenants of the order, and thereby be
freed from many duties and services which other tenants were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
subject unto; “and many tenants of other lords, perceiving the
state and greatnesse of the knights of the said order, and withall
seeing the great privileges their tenants enjoyed, did set up
crosses upon their houses, as their very tenants used to doe, to the
prejudice of their lords.”</p>

<p>This abuse led to the passing of the statute of Westminster,
the second, <i>chap. 33</i>, which recites, that many tenants did set up
crosses or cause them to be set up on their lands in prejudice of
their lords, that the tenants might defend themselves against the
chief lord of the fee by the privileges of <span class="smcap">Templars</span>, and enacts
that such lands shall be forfeited to the chief lords or to the
king. Sir Edward Coke observes, that the Templars were freed
from tenths and fifteenths to be paid to the king; that they were
discharged of purveyance; that they could not be sued for any
ecclesiastical cause before the ordinary, <i>sed coram conservatoribus
suorum privilegiorum</i>; and that of ancient time they claimed that
a felon might take to their houses, having their crosses for his
safety, as well as to any church. And concerning these conservers
or keepers of their privileges, he remarks, that the Templars
and Hospitallers “held an ecclesiasticall court before a
canonist, whom they termed <i>conservator privilegiorum suorum</i>,
which judge had indeed more authority than was convenient,
and did dayly, in respect to the height of these two orders, and
at their instance and direction, incroach upon and hold plea of
matters determinable by the common law, for <i>cui plus licet quam
par est, plus vult quam licet</i>; and this was one great mischiefe.
Another mischiefe was, that this judge likewise at their instance,
in cases wherein he had jurisdiction, would make general citations
as <i>pro salute animæ</i>, and the like, without expressing the
matter whereupon the citation was made, which also was against
law, and tended to the grievous vexation of the subject.”<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> To
remedy these evils, another act of parliament was passed, prohibiting
the Templars from bringing any man in plea before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
keepers of their privileges, for any matter the knowledge
whereof belonged to the king’s court, and commanding such
keepers of their privileges thenceforth to grant no citation at the
instance of the Templars, before it be expressed upon what
matter the citation ought to be made.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p class="caption">CHAPEL OF THE PRECEPTORY OF TEMPLE SWINGFIELD, DOVER.</p>
</div>

<p>The Grand Master of the Temple ranked in Europe as a
sovereign prince, and had precedence of all ambassadors and
peers in the general councils of the church. He was elected to
his high office by the chapter of the kingdom of Jerusalem, which
was composed of all the knights of the East and of the West
who could manage to attend. The western nations or provinces
of the order were presided over by the provincial Masters, otherwise
Grand Priors or Grand Preceptors, who were originally appointed
by the Chief Master at Jerusalem, and were in theory
mere trustees or bare administrators of the revenues of the fraternity,
accountable to the treasurer-general at Jerusalem, and
removeable at the pleasure of the Chief Master. The superior
of the Temple at London is always styled “Master of the Temple,”
and holds his chapters and has his officers corresponding to
those of the Chief Master in Palestine. The latter, consequently,
came to be denominated <i>Magnus Magister</i>, or Grand
Master. The titles given indeed to the superiors of the different
nations or provinces into which the order of the Temple was
divided, are numerous and somewhat perplexing. In the East,
these officers were known only, in the first instance, by the title
of Prior, as Prior of England, Prior of France, Prior of Portugal,
&amp;c., and afterwards Preceptor of England, Preceptor of
France, &amp;c.; but in Europe they were called Grand Priors, and
Grand Preceptors, to distinguish them from the Sub-priors and
Sub-preceptors, and also Masters of the Temple. The Prior
and Preceptor <i>of</i> England, therefore, and the Grand Prior, Grand
Preceptor, and Master of the Temple <i>in</i> England, were one and
the same person. There were also at the New Temple at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
London, in imitation of the establishment at the chief house in
Palestine, in addition to the Master, the Preceptor of the Temple,
the Prior of London, the Treasurer, and the Guardian of
the church, who had three chaplains under him called readers.</p>

<p>The Master at London had his general and particular, or his
ordinary and extraordinary chapters. The first were composed
of the grand preceptors of Scotland and Ireland, and all the
provincial priors and preceptors of the three kingdoms, who
were summoned once a year to deliberate on the state of the
Holy Land, to forward succour, to give an account of their
stewardship, and to frame new rules and regulations for the
management of the temporalities.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> The ordinary chapters were
held at the different preceptories, which the Master of the Temple
visited in succession. In these chapters new members were
admitted into the order; lands were bought, sold, and exchanged;
and presentations were made by the Master to vacant
benefices. Many of the grants and other deeds of these chapters,
with the seal of the order of the Temple annexed to them,
are to be met with in the public and private collections of manuscripts
in this country. One of the most interesting and best
preserved, is the Harleian charter, (83, c. 39,) in the British Museum,
which is a grant of land made by Brother William de la
More <span class="small">THE MARTYR</span>, the last Master of the Temple in England,
to the Lord Milo de Stapleton. It is expressed to be made by
him, with the common consent and advice of his chapter, held
at the Preceptory of Dynneslee, on the feast of Saint Barnabas
the Apostle, and concludes, “In witness whereof, we have to

<p>The Master of the Temple in England sat in parliament as
first baron of the realm, but that is to be understood among
priors only. To the parliament holden in the twenty-ninth year
of King Henry the Third, there was summoned sixty-five abbots,
thirty-five priors, and the Master of the Temple.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> The oath
taken by the grand priors, grand preceptors, or provincial Masters
in Europe, on their assumption of the duties of their high
administrative office, was drawn up in the following terms:&mdash;“I
<i>A. B.</i>, Knight of the Order of the Temple, just now appointed
Master of the knights who are in &mdash;&mdash;, promise to Jesus
Christ my Saviour, and to his vicar the sovereign pontiff and
his successors, perpetual obedience and fidelity. I swear that I
will defend, not only with my lips, but by force of arms and with
all my strength, the mysteries of the faith; the seven sacraments,
the fourteen articles of the faith, the creed of the Apostles,
and that of Saint Athanasius; the books of the Old and
the New Testament, with the commentaries of the holy fathers,
as received by the church; the unity of God, the plurality of
the persons of the holy Trinity; and the doctrine that Mary,
the daughter of Joachim and Anna, of the tribe of Judah, and
of the race of David, remained always a virgin before her delivery,
during and after her delivery. I promise likewise to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
submissive and obedient to the Master-general of the order, in
conformity with the statutes prescribed by our father Saint Bernard;
that I will at all times in case of need pass the seas to go
and fight; that I will always afford succour against the infidel
kings and princes; that in the presence of three enemies I will
fly not, but cope with them, if they are infidels; that I will not
sell the property of the order, nor consent that it be sold or
alienated; that I will always preserve chastity; that I will be
faithful to the king of &mdash;&mdash;; that I will never surrender to
the enemy the towns and places belonging to the order; and
that I will never refuse to the religious any succour that I am
able to afford them; that I will aid and defend them by words,
by arms, and by all sorts of good offices; and in sincerity and
of my own free will I swear that I will observe all these
things.”<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>Among the earliest of the Masters, or Grand Priors, or Grand
Preceptors of England, whose names figure in history, is
Richard de Hastings, who was at the head of the order in this
country on the accession of King Henry the Second to the
throne, (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1154,) and was employed by that monarch in various
important negotiations. He was the friend and confidant of
Thomas à Becket, and vainly endeavoured to terminate the disputes
between that haughty prelate and the king.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Richard de
Hastings was succeeded by Richard Mallebeench, who confirmed
a treaty of peace and concord which had been entered
into between his predecessor and the abbot of Kirkested; and
the next Master of the Temple appears to have been Geoffrey
son of Stephen, who received the patriarch Heraclius as his
guest at the new Temple on the occasion of the consecration of
the Temple church. He styles himself “<i>Minister</i> of the soldiery
of the Temple in England.”<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>In consequence of the high estimation in which the Templars
were held, and the privilege of sanctuary enjoyed by them, the
Temple at London came to be made “a storehouse of treasure.”
The wealth of the king, the nobles, the bishops, and of the
rich burghers of London, was generally deposited therein, under
the safeguard and protection of the military friars. The money
collected in the churches and chapels for the succour of the
Holy Land was also paid to the treasurer of the Temple, to be forwarded
to its destination: and the treasurer was at different times
authorised to receive the taxes imposed upon the moveables of
the ecclesiastics, also the large sums of money extorted by the
rapacious popes from the English clergy, and the annuities
granted by the king to the nobles of the kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> The money
and jewels of Hubert de Burgh, earl of Kent, the chief justiciary,
and at one time governor of the king and kingdom of England,
were deposited in the Temple, and when that nobleman was
disgraced and committed to the Tower, the king attempted to
lay hold of the treasure. Matthew Paris gives the following
curious account of the affair:&mdash;“It was suggested,” says he, “to
the king, that Hubert had no small amount of treasure deposited
in the New Temple, under the custody of the Templars.
The king accordingly, summoning to his presence the Master of
the Temple, briefly demanded of him if it was so. He indeed,
not daring to deny the truth to the king, confessed that he had
money of the said Hubert, which had been confidentially committed
to the keeping of himself and his brethren, but of the
quantity and amount thereof he was altogether ignorant. Then
the king endeavoured with threats to obtain from the brethren
the surrender to him of the aforesaid money, asserting that it
had been fraudulently subtracted from his treasury. But they
answered to the king, that money confided to them in trust they
would deliver to no man without the permission of him who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
intrusted it to be kept in the Temple. And the king, since the
above-mentioned money had been placed under their protection,
ventured not to take it by force. He sent, therefore, the treasurer
of his court, with his justices of the Exchequer, to Hubert,
who had already been placed in fetters in the Tower of London,
that they might exact from him an assignment of the entire
sum to the king. But when these messengers had explained to
Hubert the object of their coming, he immediately answered
that he would submit himself and all belonging to him to the
good pleasure of his sovereign. He therefore petitioned the
brethren of the chivalry of the Temple that they would, in his
behalf, present all his keys to his lord the king, that he might
do what he pleased with the things deposited in the Temple.
This being done, the king ordered all that money, faithfully
counted, to be placed in his treasury, and the amount of all the
things found to be reduced into writing and exhibited before
him. The king’s clerks, indeed, and the treasurer acting with
them, found deposited in the Temple gold and silver vases of
inestimable price, and money and many precious gems, an enumeration
whereof would in truth astonish the hearers.”<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>The kings of England frequently resided in the Temple, and
so also did the haughty legates of the Roman pontiffs, who
there made contributions in the name of the pope upon the
English bishoprics. Matthew Paris gives a lively account of the
exactions of the nuncio Martin, who resided for many years at
the Temple, and came there armed by the pope with powers
such as no legate had ever before possessed. “He made,”
says he, “whilst residing at London in the New Temple, unheard
of extortions of money and valuables. He imperiously
intimated to the abbots and priors that they must send him rich
presents, desirable palfreys, sumptuous services for the table, and
rich clothing; which being done, that same Martin sent back
word that the things sent were insufficient, and he commanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
the givers thereof to forward him better things, on pain of suspension
and excommunication.”<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>The convocations of the clergy and the great ecclesiastical
councils were frequently held at the Temple, and laws were there
made by the bishops and abbots for the government of the
church and monasteries in England.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>On the 10th of the calends of April, a month after the consecration
by the patriarch Heraclius of the Temple church, the
grand council or parliament of England, composed of the bishops,
earls, and barons, assembled in the house of the Hospitallers at
Clerkenwell in London. It was attended by William king of
Scotland and David his brother, and many of the counts and
barons of that distant land. The august assembly was acquainted,
in the king’s name, with the object of the solemn embassy just
sent to him from Jerusalem, and with the desire of the royal
penitent to fulfil his vow and perform his penance; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
barons were at the same time reminded of the old age of their
sovereign, of the bad state of his health, and of the necessity for
his presence in England. They accordingly represented to
King Henry that the solemn oath taken by him on his coronation
was an obligation antecedent to the penance imposed on him by
the pope; that by that oath he was bound to stay at home and
govern his dominions, and that, in their opinion, it was more
wholesome for the king’s soul to defend his own country against
the barbarous French, than to desert it for the purpose of protecting
the distant kingdom of Jerusalem.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>Fabian, in his chronicle, gives the following quaint account
of the king’s answer to the patriarch, taken from the Chron.
Joan Bromton: “Lasteley the kynge gaue answere, and sayde
that he myghte not leue hys lande wythoute kepynge, nor
yet leue yt to the praye and robbery of Frenchemen. But he
wolde gyue largely of hys own to such as wolde take upon theym
that vyge. Wyth thys answere the patryarke was dyscontente,
and sayde, ‘We seke a man, and not money; welnere euery
crysten regyon sendyth unto us money, but no land sendyth to
us a prince. Therefore we aske a prynce that nedeth money,
and not money that nedeth a prynce.’ But the kynge layde for
hym suche excuses, that the patryarke departed from hym dyscontentyd
and comforteless, whereof the kynge beynge aduertysed,
entendynge somwhat to recomforte hym with pleasaunte words,
folowed hym to the see syde. But the more the kynge thought
to satysfye hym with hys fayre speche, the more the patryarke
was dyscontentyd, in so myche that at the last he sayde unto
hym, ‘Hytherto thou haste reygned gloryously, but here after
thou shalt be forsaken of hym whom thou at thys tyme forsakeste.
Thynke on hym what he hath gyuen to thee, and what thou haste
yelden to him agayne: howe fyrste thou were false unto the kynge
of Fraunce, and after slewe that holy man Thomas of Caunterburye,
and lastely thou forsakeste the proteccyon of Crystes faith.’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
The kynge was amoued wyth these wordes, and sayde unto the
patryarke, ‘Though all the men of my lande were one bodye,
and spake with one mouth, they durste not speke to me such
wordys.’ ‘No wonder,’ sayde the patryarke, ‘for they loue thyne
and not the; that ys to meane, they loue thy goodes temporall,

And when he hadde so sayde, he offeryd hys hedde to the kynge,

kynge kepte hys paycence, and sayde, ‘I may not wende oute of

<p>According to Roger de Hoveden, however, the patriarch, on
the 17th of the calends of May, accompanied King Henry into
Normandy, where a conference was held between the sovereigns
of France and England concerning the proposed succour to the
Holy Land. Both monarchs were liberal in promises and fair
speeches; but as nothing short of the presence of the king of
England, or of one of his sons, in Palestine, would satisfy the
patriarch, that haughty ecclesiastic failed in his negotiations
and returned in disgust and disappointment to the Holy Land.
On his arrival at Jerusalem with intelligence of his ill success
the greatest consternation prevailed amongst the Latin Christians:
and it was generally observed that the true cross, which
had been recovered from the Persians by the Emperor Heraclius,
was about to be lost under the pontificate, and by the fault of a
patriarch of the same name. A cotemporary writer of Palestine
tells us that the patriarch was a very handsome person, and, in
consequence of his beauty, the mother of the king of Jerusalem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
fell in love with him, and made him archbishop of Cæsarea.
He then describes how he came to be made patriarch, and how
he was suspected to have poisoned the archbishop of Tyre.
After his return from Rome he fell in love with the wife of a
haberdasher who lived at Naplous, twelve miles from Jerusalem.
He went to see her very often, and, not long after the acquaintanceship
commenced, the husband died. Then the patriarch
brought the lady to Jerusalem, clothed her in rich apparel,
bought her a house, and furnished her with an elegant retinue.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>Baldwin the fourth, who was the reigning sovereign of
the Latin kingdom at the period of the departure of the
patriarch Heraclius and the Grand Master of the Temple for
Europe, was afflicted with a frightful leprosy, which rendered it
unlawful for him to marry, and he was consequently deprived of
all hope of having an heir of his body to inherit the crown.
Sensible of the dangers and inconvenience of a female succession,
he selected William V. marquis of Montferrat, surnamed
“Long-sword,” as a husband for his eldest sister Sibylla.
Shortly after his marriage the marquis of Montferrat died, leaving
by Sibylla an infant son named Baldwin. Sibylla’s second
husband was Guy de Lusignan, a nobleman of a handsome person,
and descended of an ancient family of Poitou in France.
Her choice was at first approved of by the king, who received
his new brother-in-law with favour, loaded him with honours,
and made him regent of the kingdom. Subsequently, through
the intrigues of the count of Tripoli, the king was induced to
deprive Guy de Lusignan of the regency, and to set aside the
claims of Sibylla to the throne, in favour of her son the young
Baldwin, who was then about five years of age. He gave orders
for the coronation of the young prince, and resigned his authority
to the count of Tripoli, who was appointed regent of the
kingdom during the minority of the sovereign, whilst all
the fortresses and castles of the land were committed to the safe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
keeping of the Templars and Hospitallers. The youthful Baldwin
was carried with vast pomp to the great church of the Holy
Sepulchre, and was there anointed and crowned by the patriarch
in the presence of the Grand Masters of the Temple and the
Hospital. According to ancient custom he was taken, wearing
his crown, to the Temple of the Lord, to make certain offerings,
after which he went to the Temple of Solomon, where the Templars
resided, and was entertained at dinner, together with his
barons, by the Grand Master of the Temple and the military
friars. Shortly after the coronation (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1186) the ex-king,
Baldwin IV., died at Jerusalem, and was buried in the church of
the Resurrection, by the side of Godfrey de Bouillon, and the
other Christian kings. His death was followed, in the short
space of seven months, by that of the infant sovereign Baldwin
V., and Sibylla thus became the undoubted heiress to the throne.
The count of Tripoli refused, however, to surrender the regency,
accusing Sibylla of the horrible and improbable crime of poisoning
her own child. But Gerard de Riderfort, the Grand Master
of the Temple, invited her to repair to Jerusalem, and gave
orders for the coronation. He sent letters, in the queen’s name,
to the count of Tripoli and the rebellious barons who had assembled
with their followers in arms at Naplous, (the ancient
Shechem,) requiring them to attend at the appointed time to do
homage, and take the oath of allegiance, but the barons sent back
word that they intended to remain where they were; and they
despatched two Cistercian abbots to the Grand Master of the
Temple, and the patriarch Heraclius, exhorting them for the
love of God and his holy apostles to refrain from crowning
Isabella countess of Jaffa, as long as she remained the wife of
Guy de Lusignan. They represented that the latter had already
manifested his utter incapacity for command, both in the field
and in the cabinet; that the kingdom of Jerusalem required an
able general for its sovereign; and they insisted that Sibylla
should be immediately divorced from Guy de Lusignan, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
should choose a husband better fitted to protect the country and
undertake the conduct of the government.</p>

<p>As soon as this message had been received, the Grand Master
of the Temple directed the Templars to take possession of all
the gates of the city of Jerusalem, and issued strict orders that
no person should be allowed to enter or withdraw from the Holy
City without an express permission from himself. Sibylla and
Guy de Lusignan were then taken, guarded by the Templars, to
the great church of the Resurrection, where the patriarch Heraclius
and all his clergy were in readiness to receive them.
The crowns of the Latin kingdom were kept in a large chest in
the treasury, fastened with two locks. The Grand Master of the
Temple kept the key of one of these locks, and the Grand Master
of the Hospital had the other. On their arrival at the
church, the key of the Grand Master of the Temple was produced,
but the key of the Grand Master of the Hospital was not
forthcoming, nor could that illustrious chieftain himself anywhere
be found. Gerard de Riderfort and Heraclius at last
went in person to the Hospital, and after much hunting about
they found the Grand Master, and immediately demanded the
key in the queen’s name.</p>

<p>The powerful Superior of the Hospitallers at first refused to
produce it, but being pressed by many arguments and entreaties,
he at last took out the key and flung it upon the ground, whereupon
the patriarch picked it up, and proceeding to the treasury,
speedily produced the two crowns, one of which he placed upon
the high altar of the church of the Resurrection, and the other
by the side of the chair upon which the countess of Jaffa was
seated. Heraclius then performed the solemn ceremony of the
coronation, and when he had placed the crown on the queen’s
head, he reminded her that she was a frail and feeble woman,
but ill fitted to contend with the toil and strife in which the beleaguered
kingdom of Palestine was continually involved, and he
therefore exhorted her to make choice of some person to govern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
the kingdom in conjunction with herself; whereupon her majesty,
taking up the crown which had been placed by her side,
and calling for her husband, Guy de Lusignan, thus addressed
him:&mdash;“Those whom God hath joined, let no man put asunder.
Sire, receive this crown, for I know none more worthy of it than
yourself.” And immediately Guy de Lusignan was crowned
king of Jerusalem, and received the blessing of the patriarch.</p>

<p>Great was the indignation of the count of Tripoli and the
barons, when they received intelligence of these events. They
raised the standard of revolt, and proclaimed the princess
Isabella, the younger sister of Sibylla, who had been married, at
the early period of eight years, to Humphrey de Thoron, queen
of Jerusalem. As soon as Humphrey de Thoron heard of the
proceedings of the count of Tripoli and the barons, he hurried
with the princess to Jerusalem, and the two, throwing themselves
at the feet of the king and queen, respectfully tendered
to them their allegiance. This loyal and decisive conduct struck
terror and dismay into the hearts of the conspirators, most of
whom now proceeded to Jerusalem to do homage; whilst the
count of Tripoli, deserted by his adherents, retired to the strong
citadel of Tiberias, of which place he was the feudal lord, and
there remained, proudly defying the royal power.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>The king at first sought to avail himself of the assistance of
the Templars against his rebellious vassal, and exhorted them to
besiege Tiberias; but they refused, as it was contrary to their
oaths, and the spirit of their institution, for them to undertake
an aggressive warfare against any christian prince. The king
then gave orders for the concentration of an army at Nazareth;
the count of Tripoli prepared to defend Tiberias, and it appears
unquestionable that he sent to Saladin for assistance, and en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>tered
into a defensive and independent alliance with that monarch.
The citadel of Tiberias was a place of great strength, the military
power of the count was very considerable, and the friends of the
king, foreseeing that the infidels would not fail to take advantage
of a civil war, earnestly besought his majesty to offer terms of
reconciliation to his powerful vassal. It was accordingly agreed
that the Grand Masters of the Temple and the Hospital should
proceed with the archbishop of Tyre, the Lord Balian d’Ibelin,
and the Lord Reginald of Sidon, to Tiberias, and attempt to
bring back the count to his allegiance. These illustrious personages
set out from Jerusalem, and slept the first night at
Naplous, of which town Balian d’Ibelin was the feudal lord, and
the next day they journeyed on towards Nazareth. As they drew
near that place, the Grand Master of the Temple proceeded to
pass the night at a neighbouring fortress of the Knights Templars,
called “the castle of La Feue,” and was eating his supper
with the brethren in the refectory of the convent, when intelligence
was brought to him that a strong corps of the Mussulman
cavalry, under the command of Malek al Afdal, one of Saladin’s
sons, had crossed the Jordan at sunrise, and was marching
through the territories of the count of Tripoli.</p>

<p>The chronicle of the Holy Land, written by Radolph, abbot
of the monastery of Coggleshale in Essex, forms the most important
and trustworthy account now in existence of the conquest
of Jerusalem by Saladin, for the writer was, as he tells us, an
eye-witness of all the remarkable events he relates. Radolph was
an English monk of the Cistercian order, and a man of vast
learning and erudition. He went on a pilgrimage to Palestine,
and was there on the breaking out of the war which immediately
preceded the loss of the Holy City. He was present at the siege
of Jerusalem, and was wounded by an arrow, “which,” says the
worthy abbot, “pierced through the nose of the relator of these
circumstances; the wood was withdrawn, but a part of the iron
barb remains to this day.” His chronicle was published in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
1729, by the fathers Martene and Durand, in their valuable collection
of ancient chronicles and manuscripts. It commences
in the year 1187, and finishes in 1191.</p>

<p>As soon as the Grand Master of the Temple heard that the
infidels had crossed the Jordan and were ravaging the christian
territories, he sent messengers to a castle of the Templars called
“The Convent of Caco,” situate four miles distant from La Feue,
commanding all the knights that could be spared from the garrison
at that place to mount and come to him with speed. The
knights had retired to rest when the messengers arrived, but
they arose from their beds, and at midnight they were encamped
with their horses around the walls of the castle of La Feue.
The next morning, as soon as it was light, the Grand Master, at
the head of ninety of his knights, rode over to Nazareth, and
was joined at that place by the Grand Master of the Hospital
and forty knights of the garrison of Nazareth. The Templars
and Hospitallers were accompanied by four hundred of their
foot soldiers, and the whole force, under the command of the
two Grand Masters, amounted to about six hundred men. With
this small but valiant band, they set out in quest of the infidels,
and had proceeded about seven miles from Nazareth in the direction
of the Jordan, when they came suddenly upon a strong
column of Mussulman cavalry amounting to several thousand
men, who were watering their horses at the brook Kishon.
Without waiting to count the number of their enemies, the Templars
raised their war cry, unfolded the blood-red banner, and
dashed into the midst of the astonished and terrified Mussulmen,
dealing around them, to use the words of Abbot Coggleshale,
“death and damnation.” The infidels, taken by surprise, were
at first thrown into confusion, discomfited, and slaughtered; but
when the smallness of the force opposed to them became apparent,
they closed in upon the Templars, overwhelmed them with
darts and missiles, and speedily thinned their ranks with a terrific
slaughter. An eye-witness tells us that the military friars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
were to be seen bathed with blood and sweat; trembling with
fatigue; with their horses killed under them, and with their
swords and lances broken, closing with the Mussulman warriors,
and rolling headlong with them in the dust. Some tore the
darts with which they had been transfixed from their bodies, and
hurled them back with a convulsive effort upon the enemy; and
others, having lost all their weapons in the affray, clung around
the necks of their opponents, dragged them from their horses,
and endeavoured to strangle them under the feet of the combatants.
Jacqueline de Mailly, Marshal of the Temple, performed
prodigies of valour. He was mounted on a white horse,
and clothed in the white habit of his order, with the blood-red
cross, the symbol of martyrdom, on his breast; he became,
through his gallant bearing and demeanour, an object of admiration,
even to the Moslems. Radolph compares the fury and the
anger of this warlike monk, as he looked around him upon his
slaughtered brethren, to the wrath of the lioness who has lost
her whelps; and his position and demeanour in the midst of the
throng of infidels, he likens to that of the wild boar when surrounded
by dogs whom he is tearing with his tusks. Every blow
of this furious man, says the worthy abbot, “despatched an
infidel to hell;” but with all his valour Jacqueline de Mailly
was slain.</p>

<p>In this bloody battle perished the Grand Master of the Hospital
and all the Templars excepting the Grand Master, Gerard
de Riderford, and two of his knights, who broke through the
dense ranks of the Moslems, and made their escape to Nazareth.
The Mussulmen severed the heads of the slaughtered Templars
from their bodies, and attaching them with cords to the points
of their lances, they marched off in the direction of Tiberias.
This disastrous engagement was fought on Friday, the 1st of
May, the feast of St. James and St. Philip. “In that beautiful
season of the year,” says Abbot Coggleshale, “when the inhabitants
of Nazareth were wont to seek the rose and the violet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
in the fields, they found only the sad traces of carnage, and the
lifeless bodies of their slaughtered brethren. With mourning
and great lamentation they carried them into the burial-ground
of the blessed Virgin Mary at Nazareth, crying aloud, ‘Daughters
of Galilee, put on your mourning clothes, and ye daughters
of Zion, bewail the misfortunes that threaten the kings of
Judah.’”</p>

<p>Whilst this bloody battle was being fought, the Lord Balian
d’Ibelin was journeying with another party of Templars from
Naplous to join the Grand Master at Nazareth, and the following
interesting account is given of their march towards that place.
“When they had travelled two miles, they came to the city of
Sebaste. It was a lovely morning, and they determined to
march no further until they had heard mass. They accordingly
turned towards the house of the bishop and awoke him up, and
informed him that the day was breaking. The bishop accordingly
ordered an old chaplain to put on his clothes and say
mass, after which they hastened forwards. Then they came to
the castle of La Feue, (a fortress of the Templars,) and there they
found, outside the castle, the tents of the convent of Caco
pitched, and there was no one to explain what it meant. A
varlet was sent into the castle to inquire, but he found no one
within but two sick people who were unable to speak. Then
they marched towards Nazareth, and after they had proceeded
a short distance from the castle of La Feue, they met a brother
of the Temple on horseback, who galloped up to them at a
furious rate, calling out, ‘Bad news, bad news;’ and he informed
them how that the Master of the Hospital had had his head cut
off, and how of all the brothers of the Temple there had escaped
but three, the Master of the Temple and two others, and that
the knights whom the king had placed in garrison at Nazareth,
were all taken and killed.” “If Balian d’Ibelin,” says the chronicler,
“had marched straight to Nazareth, with his knights, instead
of halting to hear mass at Sebaste, he would have been in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
time to have saved his brethren from slaughter.” As it was, he
arrived just in time to hear the funeral service read over their
dead bodies by William, archbishop of Tyre.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>The Grand Master of the Temple, who was at Nazareth, suffering
severely from his wounds, hastened to collect together a
small force at that place to open the communications with Tiberias,
which being done, the Lord Balian d’Ibelin and the archbishop
of Tyre proceeded to that place to have their interview
with the count of Tripoli. The Grand Master accompanied
them as far as the hill above the citadel, but not liking to trust
himself into the power of the count, he then retraced his steps
to Nazareth. Both the Moslem and the Christian writers agree
in asserting that the count of Tripoli had at this period entered
into an alliance with Saladin; nevertheless, either smitten
with remorse for his past conduct, or moved by the generous
overtures of the king, he consented to do homage and become
reconciled to his sovereign, and for this purpose immediately
set out from Tiberias for Jerusalem. The interview and reconciliation
between the king and the count took place at Joseph’s
well, near Naplous, in the presence of the Templars and Hospitallers,
and the bishops and barons. The count knelt upon
one knee and did homage, whereupon the king raised him up
and kissed him, and they then both returned together to Naplous
to take measures for the protection of the country.</p>

<p>Saladin, on the other hand, was concentrating together a large
army and rapidly maturing his plans for the reconquest of the
Holy City&mdash;the long-cherished enterprise of the Mussulmen.
Whilst discord and dissensions had been gradually undermining
the strength of the Christian empire, Saladin had been carefully
extending and consolidating his power. He had reduced the
various independent chieftains of the north of Syria to submission
to his throne and government; he had conquered the cities
of Mecca and Medina, and the whole of Arabia Felix; and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
vast empire now extended from Tripoli, in Africa, to the Tigris,
and from the Indian Ocean to the mountains of Armenia. The
Arabian writers enthusiastically recount his pious exhortations
to the true believers to arm in defence of Islam, and describe
with vast enthusiasm his glorious preparations for the holy war.
Bohadin, son of Sjeddadi, his friend and secretary, and great
biographer, before venturing upon the sublime task of describing
his famous and sacred actions, makes a solemn confession of
faith, and offers up praises to the one true God. “Praise be to
<span class="smcap">God</span>,” says he, “who hath blessed us with <i>Islam</i>, and hath led
us to the understanding of the true faith beautifully put together,
and hath befriended us; and, through the intercession of our
prophet, hath loaded us with every blessing. I bear witness
that there is no God but that one <span class="smcap">great God</span> who hath <i>no
partner</i>, (a testimony that will deliver our souls from the smoky
fire of hell,) that <span class="smcap">Mohammed</span> is his <i>servant</i> and <i>apostle</i>, who hath
opened unto us the gates of the right road to salvation. These
solemn duties being performed, I will begin to write concerning
the victorious <span class="small">DEFENDER</span> <i>of the</i> <span class="small">FAITH</span>, the tamer of the followers
of the cross, the lifter up of the standard of justice and equity,
the saviour of the world and of religion, Saladin Aboolmodaffer
Joseph, the son of Job, the son of Schadi, Sultan of the Moslems,
ay, and of Islam itself; the deliverer of the holy house of
God (the Temple) from the hands of the idolaters, the servant
of two holy cities, whose tomb may the Lord moisten with the
dew of his favour, affording to him the sweetness of the fruits of
the faith.”<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>Crowds of Mussulmen from all parts of Asia crowded round
the standard of Saladin, and the caliph of Bagdad and all the
imauns put up daily prayers for the success of his arms. After
protecting the return of the caravan from Mecca, Saladin marched
to Ashtara, probably the Ashtaroth Karnain of scripture, belonging
to the tribe of Manasseh, not far from Damascus. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
was there met by his son, <i>Al Malek al Afdal</i>, “Most excellent
Prince,” and <i>Moh-hafferoddin ibn Zinoddin</i>, with the army under
their command. Being afterwards joined by the forces of <i>Al
Mawsel</i>, commanded by <i>Màsûd al Zaf’arâni</i>, <i>Maredin</i>, and <i>Hamah</i>,
he reviewed his army, first on the hill called Tel Taisel, and
afterwards at Ashtara, the place of general rendezvous. Whilst
completing his preparations at this place, Saladin received intelligence
of the reconciliation of the count of Tripoli with the
king of Jerusalem, and he determined instantly to lay siege to
Tiberias. For this purpose, on Friday the 17th of the month
Rabi, he advanced in three divisions upon Al Soheira, a village
situate at the northern end of the Lake of Tiberias, where he encamped
for the night. The next day he marched round to the
western shore of the lake, and proceeded towards Tiberias in
battle array. On the 21st Rabi, he took the town by storm, put
all who resisted to the sword, and made slaves of the survivors.
The place was then set on fire and reduced to ashes. The
countess of Tripoli retired with the garrison into the citadel, and
from thence she sent messengers to her husband and the king of
Jerusalem, earnestly imploring instant succour.</p>

<p>The king had pitched his tents at Sepphoris, and all the
chivalry of the Latin kingdom were hastening to join his standard
and make a last effort in defence of the tottering kingdom
of Jerusalem. The Templars and Hospitallers collected together
a strong force from their different castles and fortresses,<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> and
came into the camp with the holy cross which had been brought
from the church of the Resurrection, to be placed in the front of
the christian array. The count of Tripoli joined them with the
men of Tripoli and Galilee. Prince Reginald of Mount Royal,
made his appearance at the head of a body of light cavalry. The
Lord Balian of Naplous came in with all his armed retainers,
and Reginald, Lord of Sidon, marched into the camp with the
men from the sea coast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>The Grand Master of the Temple had brought with him the
treasure which had been sent to the Templars by the king of
England, to be employed in the defence of the Holy Land, in expiation
of the murder of St. Thomas à Becket, and it was found
very acceptable in the exhausted condition of the Latin treasury.
Whilst the christian forces were assembling at Sepphoris,
Saladin sent forward a strong corps of cavalry, which ravaged
and laid waste all the country around the brook Kishon, from
Tiberias to Bethoron, and from the mountains of Gilboa and
Jezreel to Nazareth. From all the eminences nought was to be
seen but the smoking ruins of the villages, hamlets, and scattered
dwellings of the christian population. The whole country,
before the very noses of the warriors of the cross, was enveloped in
flame and smoke, and the christian camp was filled with fugitives
who had fled with terror before the merciless swords of the
Moslems. To complete the misfortunes of the Latins, the king
was irresolute and continually giving contradictory commands,
and the christian chieftains, having lost all confidence in their
leader, and despairing of being able to contend with success
against the vast power of Saladin, seemed to be preparing for a
retreat to the sea coast, rather than for a desperate struggle with
the infidels for the preservation of Jerusalem. Upon this ground
only can be explained the long delay of the christian army at
Sepphoris. This place, the ancient capital of Galilee, is situate
between Nazareth and Acre, and an army could at any time
secure an easy and safe retreat from it to the port of the last-named
city. Here, then, the Christians remained, quietly permitting
Saladin to occupy a strong position from whence he
could pour his vast masses of cavalry into the great plain of
Esdraelon, and open for himself a direct road to the Holy City,
either through the valley of the Jordan, or through the great
plain along the bases of the mountains of Gilboa.</p>

<p>When the messengers from the countess of Tripoli arrived
in the christian camp, with intelligence that Saladin had burnt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
and stormed the town of Tiberias, and that the countess had retired
into the citadel, the king called a council of war. This
council assembled in the royal tent, on the evening of the 2nd
of July, <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1187, and there were present at it, Gerard de Riderfort,
the Grand Master of the Temple, the newly-elected Grand
Master of the Hospital, the archbishop of Tyre, the count of
Tripoli, Balian d’Ibelin, lord of Naplous, and nearly all the
bishops and barons of Palestine. The count of Tripoli, although
his capital was in flames, his territories spoiled by the enemy,
and his countess closely besieged, advised the king to remain
inactive where he was; but the Grand Master of the Temple,
hearing this advice, rose up in the midst of the assembly, and
stigmatized the count as a traitor, urging the king instantly to
march to the relief of Tiberias. The barons, however, sided
with the count of Tripoli, and it was determined that the army
should remain at Sepphoris. The council broke up; each man
retired to his tent, and the king went to supper. But the Grand
Master of the Temple, agitated by a thousand conflicting emotions,
could not rest. At midnight he arose and sought the presence
of the king. He reproached him for remaining in a state
of inaction at Sepphoris, whilst the enemy was ravaging and
laying waste all the surrounding country, and reducing the
Christian population to a state of hopeless bondage. “It will be
an everlasting reproach to you, sire,” said he, “if you quietly
permit the infidels to take before your face an important christian
citadel, which you ought to feel it your first duty to defend.
Know that the Templars will sooner tear the white mantle from
their shoulders, and sell all that they possess, than remain any
longer quiet spectators of the injury and disgrace that have been
brought upon the christian arms.”</p>

<p>Moved by the discourse of the Grand Master, the king consented
to march to the relief of Tiberias, and at morning’s dawn
the tents of the Templars were struck, and the trumpets of the
order sounded the advance. In vain did the count of Tripoli<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
and the barons oppose this movement, the king and the Templars
were resolute, and the host of the cross soon covered, in full
array, the winding road leading to Tiberias. The count of
Tripoli insisted upon leading the van of the army, as the christian
forces were marching through his territories, and the Templars
consequently brought up the rear. The patriarch Heraclius,
whose duty it was to bear the holy cross in front of the christian
array, had remained at Jerusalem, and had confided his sacred
charge to the bishops of Acre and Lidda, a circumstance which
gave rise to many gloomy forebodings amongst the superstitious
soldiers of Christ.</p>

<p>As soon as Saladin heard of the advance of the christian army,
he turned the siege of the citadel of Tiberias into a blockade,
called in his detachments of cavalry, and hastened to occupy all
the passes and defiles of the mountains leading to Tiberias.
The march of the infidel host, which amounted to 80,000
horse and foot, over the hilly country, is compared by an Arabian
writer, an eye-witness, to mountains in movement, or to the vast
waves of an agitated sea. Saladin encamped on the hills beyond
Tiberias, resting his left wing upon the lake, and planting his
cavalry in the valleys. When the Latin forces had arrived
within three miles of Tiberias, they came in sight of the Mussulman
army, and were immediately assailed by the light cavalry of
the Arabs. During the afternoon of that day a bloody battle
was fought. The Christians attempted, but in vain, to penetrate
the defiles of the mountains; and when the evening came they
found that they had merely been able to hold their ground
without advancing a single step. Instead of fighting his way, at
all hazards, to the lake of Tiberias, or falling back upon some
position where he could have secured a supply of water, the king,
following the advice of the count of Tripoli, committed the fatal
mistake of ordering the tents to be pitched. “When the Saracens
saw that the Christians had pitched their tents,” says the
chronicler, “they came and encamped so close to them that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
soldiers of the two armies could converse together, and not even
a cat could escape from the Christian lines without the knowledge
of the Saracens.” It was a sultry summer’s night, the army of
the cross was hemmed in amongst dry and barren rocks, and both
the men and horses, after their harassing and fatiguing march,
threw themselves on the parched ground, sighing in vain for
water. During the livelong night, not a drop of that precious
element touched their lips, and the soldiers arose exhausted and
unrefreshed, for the toil, and labour, and fierce warfare of the
ensuing day.</p>

<p>At sunrise the Templars formed in battle array in the van of
the Christian army, and prepared to open a road through the
dense ranks of the infidels to the lake of Tiberias. An Arabian
writer, who witnessed the movement of their dense and compact
columns at early dawn, speaks of them as “terrible in arms,
having their whole bodies cased with triple mail.” He compares
the noise made by their advancing squadrons to the <i>loud humming
of bees!</i> and describes them as animated with “a flaming desire
of vengeance.”<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Saladin had behind him the lake of Tiberias,
his infantry was in the centre, and the swift cavalry of the desert
was stationed on either wing, under the command of <i>Faki-ed-deen</i>
(teacher of religion). The Templars rushed, we are told, like
lions upon the Moslem infidels, and nothing could withstand
their heavy and impetuous charge. “Never,” says an Arabian
doctor of the law, “have I seen bolder or more powerful soldiers;
none more to be feared by the believers in the true faith.”
Saladin set fire to the dry grass and dwarf shrubs which lay between
both armies, and the wind blew the smoke and the flames
directly into the faces of the military friars and their horses.
The fire, the noise, the gleaming weapons, and all the accompaniments
of the horrid scene, have given full scope to the descriptive
powers of the oriental writers. They compare it to the
last judgment; the dust and the smoke obscured the face of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
sun, and the day was turned into night. Sometimes gleams of
light darted like the rapid lightning amid the throng of combatants;
then you might see the dense columns of armed warriors,
now immoveable as mountains, and now sweeping swiftly across
the landscape like the rainy clouds over the face of heaven.
“The sons of paradise and the children of fire,” say they,
“then decided their terrible quarrel; the arrows rustled through
the air like the wings of innumerable sparrows, the sparks flew
from the coats of mail and the glancing sabres, and the blood
spurting forth from the bosom of the throng deluged the earth
like the rains of heaven.”... “The avenging sword of the
true believers was drawn forth against the infidels; the faith of
the <span class="small">UNITY</span> was opposed to the faith of the <span class="small">TRINITY</span>, and speedy
ruin, desolation, and destruction, overtook the miserable sons of
baptism!”</p>

<p>The lake of Tiberias was two miles distant from the Templars,
and ever and anon its blue and placid waters were to be seen
calmly reposing in the bright sun-beams, or winding gracefully
amid the bosom of the distant mountains; but every inch of the
road was fiercely contested; the expert archers of the Mussulmen
lined all the eminences, and the thirsty soil was drenched
with the blood of the best and bravest of the christian warriors.
After almost superhuman exertions, the Templars and Hospitallers
halted, and sent to the king for succour. At this critical
juncture the count of Tripoli, who had always insisted on being
in the van, and whose conduct, from first to last, had been most
suspicious, dashed with a few followers through a party of
Mussulmen, who opened their ranks to let him pass, and fled in
safety to Tyre. The flight of this distinguished nobleman gave
rise to a sudden panic, and the troops that were advancing to the
support of the Templars were driven in one confused mass
upon the main body. The military friars, who rarely turned
their backs upon the enemy, maintained, alone and unaided, a
short, sharp, and bloody conflict, which ended in the death or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
captivity of every one of them excepting the Grand Master of
the Hospital, who clove his way from the field of battle, and
reached Ascalon in safety, but died of his wounds the day after
his arrival.</p>

<p>The Christian soldiers now gave themselves up to despair;
the infantry, which was composed principally of the native population
of Palestine, men taken from the plough and the pruning-hook,
crowded together in disorder and confusion, around the
bishops and the holy cross. They were so wedged together that
they were unable to act against the enemy, and they refused to
obey their leaders. Brother Terric, Grand Preceptor of the
Temple, who had been attached to the person of the king, the
Lord Reginald of Sidon, Balian d’Ibelin, lord of Naplous, and
many of the lesser barons and knights, collected their followers
together, rushed over the rocks, down the mountain sides,
pierced through the enemies’ squadrons, and leaving the infantry
to their fate, made their escape to the sea coast. The
Arab cavalry dashed on, and surrounding, with terrific cries, the
trembling and unresisting foot soldiers, they mowed them down
with a frightful carnage.</p>

<p>In vain did the bishops of Ptolemais and Lidda, who supported
with difficulty the Holy Cross in the midst of the disordered
throng, attempt to infuse into the base-born peasantry
some of that daring valour and fiery-religious enthusiasm which
glowed so fiercely in the breasts of the Moslems. The Christian
fugitives were crowded together like a flock of sheep when
attacked by dogs, and their bitter cries for mercy ever and anon
rent the air, between the loud shouts of <span class="smcap">Allah</span> <i>acbar</i>&mdash;“<span class="smcap">God</span> is
victorious.” The Moslem chieftains pressed into the heart of
the throng, and cleft their way towards the Holy Cross; the
bishop of Ptolemais was slain, the bishop of Lidda was made
captive, and the cross itself fell into the hands of the infidels.
The king of Jerusalem, the Grand Master of the Temple, the
Marquis of Montferrat, the Lord Reginald de Chatillon, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
many other nobles and knights, were at the same time taken
prisoners and led away into captivity. “Alas, alas,” says Abbot
Coggleshale, “that I should have lived to have seen in my time
these awful and terrible calamities.” When the sun had sunk to
rest, and darkness had put an end to the slaughter, a crowd of
Christian fugitives, who survived the long and frightful carnage,
attempted to gain the summit of Mount Hittin, in the vain hope
of escaping from the field of blood, under cover of the obscurity
of the night. But every pass and avenue were strictly
watched, and when morning came they were found cowering on
the elevated summit of the mountain. They were maddened
with thirst and exhausted with watching, but despair gave them
some energy; they availed themselves with success of the
strength of their position, and in the first onslaught the Moslems
were repulsed. The sloping sides of Mount Hittin were covered
with dry grass and thistles, which had been scorched and killed
by the hot summer’s sun, and the Moslems again resorted to the
expedient of setting fire to the parched vegetation. The heat of
a July sun, added to that of the raging flames, soon told with
fearful effect upon the weakened frames of the poor Christian
warriors, who were absolutely dying with thirst; some threw
away their arms and cast themselves upon the ground; some
cried for mercy, and others calmly awaited the approach of
death.</p>

<p>The Moslem appetite for blood had at this time been slaked;
feelings of compassion for the misfortunes of the fallen had
arisen in their breasts, and as resistance had now ceased in every
quarter of the field, the lives of the fugitives on Mount Hittin
were mercifully spared. Thus ended the memorable battle of
Tiberias, which commenced on the afternoon of the 3rd of
July, and ended oh the morning of Saturday, the 5th. The
multitude of captives taken by the Moslems was enormous;
cords could not be found to bind them, the tent ropes were all
used for the purpose, but were insufficient, and the Arabian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
writers tell us, that on seeing the dead, one would have thought
that there could have been no prisoners, and on seeing the prisoners,
that there could be no dead. “I saw,” says the secretary
and companion of Saladin, who was present at this terrible
fight, and is unable to restrain himself from pitying the disasters
of the vanquished&mdash;“I saw the mountains and the plains, the
hills and the valleys, covered with their dead. I saw their fallen
and deserted banners sullied with dust and with blood. I saw
their heads broken and battered, their limbs scattered abroad,
and the blackened corpses piled one upon another like the
stones of the builders. I called to mind the words of the Koran,
‘The infidel shall say, What am I but <i>dust</i>?’... I saw thirty
or forty tied together by one cord. I saw in one place, guarded
by one Mussulman, two hundred of these famous warriors gifted
with amazing strength, who had but just now walked forth
amongst the mighty: their proud bearing was gone: they
stood naked with downcast eyes, wretched and miserable....
The lying infidels were now in the power of the true
believers. Their king and their cross were captured, that cross
before which they bow the head and bend the knee; which they
bear aloft and worship with their eyes; they say that it is the
identical wood to which the God whom they adore was fastened.
They had adorned it with fine gold and brilliant stones; they
carried it before their armies; they all bowed towards it with
respect. It was their first duty to defend it; and he who should
desert it would never enjoy peace of mind. The capture of
this cross was more grievous to them than the captivity of their
king. Nothing can compensate them for the loss of it. It was
their God; they prostrated themselves in the dust before it, and
sang hymns when it was raised aloft!”</p>

<p>As soon as all fighting had ceased on the field of battle, Saladin
proceeded to a tent, whither, in obedience to his commands, the
king of Jerusalem, Gerard de Riderfort, the Grand Master of
the Temple, and Reginald de Chatillon had been conducted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
This last nobleman had greatly distinguished himself in various
daring expeditions against the caravans of pilgrims travelling to
Mecca, and had become on that account particularly obnoxious
to the pious Saladin. The sultan, on entering the tent, ordered
a bowl of sherbet, the sacred pledge amongst the Arabs of hospitality
and security, to be presented to the fallen monarch of
Jerusalem, and to the Grand Master of the Temple; but when
Reginald de Chatillon would have drunk thereof, Saladin prevented
him, and reproaching the christian nobleman with perfidy
and impiety, he commanded him instantly to acknowledge
the prophet whom he had blasphemed, or to be prepared to meet
the death he had so often deserved. On Reginald’s refusal,
Saladin struck him with his scimitar, and he was immediately
despatched by the guards. Bohadin, Saladin’s friend and secretary,
an eye-witness of the scene, gives the following account of
it: “Then Saladin told the interpreter to say thus to the king,
‘It is thou, not I, who givest drink to this man!’ Then the sultan
sat down at the entrance of the tent, and they brought Prince
Reginald before him, and after refreshing the man’s memory,
Saladin said to him, ‘Now then, I myself will act the part of
the defender of Mohammed!’ He then offered the man the Mohammedan
faith, but he refused it; then the king struck him
on the shoulder with a drawn scimitar, which was a hint to those
that were present to do for him; so they sent his soul to <i>hell</i>,
and cast out his body before the tent door!”</p>

<p>The next day Saladin proceeded in cold blood to enact the
grand concluding tragedy. The warlike monks of the Temple
and of the Hospital, the bravest and most zealous defenders of
the christian faith, were, of all the warriors of the cross, the most
obnoxious to zealous Mussulmen, and it was determined that
death or conversion to Mahometanism should be the portion of
every captive of either order, excepting the Grand Master of the
Temple, for whom it was expected a heavy ransom would be
given. Accordingly, on the christian Sabbath, at the hour of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
sunset, the appointed time of prayer, the Moslems were drawn
up in battle array under their respective leaders. The Mamlook
emirs stood in two ranks clothed in yellow, and, at the sound of
the holy trumpet, all the captive knights of the Temple and of
the Hospital were led on to the eminence above Tiberias, in full
view of the beautiful lake of Gennesareth, whose bold and
mountainous shores had been the scene of so many of their
Saviour’s miracles. There, as the last rays of the sun were
fading away from the mountain tops, they were called upon to
deny him who had been crucified, to choose God for their Lord,
Islam for their faith, Mecca for their temple, the Moslems for
their brethren, and Mahomet for their prophet. To a man they
refused, and were all decapitated in the presence of Saladin by
the devout zealots of his army, and the doctors and expounders
of the law. An oriental historian, who was present, says that
Saladin sat with a smiling countenance viewing the execution,
and that some of the executioners cut off the heads with a degree
of dexterity that excited great applause. “Oh,” say Omad’eddin
Muhammed, “how beautiful an ornament is the blood of the
infidels sprinkled over the followers of the faith and the true religion!”<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
If the Mussulmen displayed a becoming zeal in the
decapitation and annihilation of the infidel Templars, these last
manifested a no less praiseworthy eagerness for martyrdom by
the swords of the unbelieving Moslems. The Knight Templar,
Brother Nicolas, strove vigorously, we are told, with his companions
to be the first to suffer, and with great difficulty accomplished
his purpose. It was believed by the Christians, in
accordance with the superstitious ideas of those times, that
heaven testified its approbation by a visible sign, and that for
three nights, during which the bodies of the Templars re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>mained
unburied on the field, celestial rays of light played
around the corpses of those holy martyrs.</p>

<p>Immediately after this fatal battle, the citadel of Tiberias surrendered
to Saladin, and the countess of Tripoli was permitted to
depart in safety in search of her fugitive husband. There was
now no force in the Latin kingdom capable of offering the least
opposition to the victorious career of the infidels, and Saladin,
in order that he might overrun and subjugate the whole country
with the greatest possible rapidity, divided his army into several
bodies, which were to proceed in different directions, and assemble
at last under the walls of Jerusalem. One strong column, under the
command of Malek el Afdal, proceeded to attack La Feue or Faba,
the castle of the Knights Templars. Nearly all the garrison had
perished in the battle of Tiberias, and after a short conflict the infidels
walked into the fortress, over the dead bodies of the last of its
defenders. From thence they crossed the great plain to Sebaste,
and entered the magnificent church erected by the empress
Helena, over the prison in which St. John the Baptist was beheaded,
and over the humble grave where still repose the remains
of St. John and of Zacharias and Elizabeth his parents. The
terrified bishop and clergy had removed all the gold and silver
vessels from the altars and the rich copes and vestments of the
priests, to conceal them from the cupidity of the Moslems,
whereupon these last caused the bishop to be stripped naked
and beaten with rods, and led away all his clergy into captivity.
The wild Turcoman and Bedouin cavalry then dashed up the
beautiful valley of Succoth to Naplous, the ancient Shechem;
which they found deserted and desolate; the inhabitants had
abandoned their dwellings and fled to Jerusalem, and the Mussulmen
planted their banners upon the gray battlements of the
castle, and upon the lofty summit of Mount Gerizim. They
then pitched their tents around the interesting well where our
Saviour spoke with the woman of Samaria, and pastured their
cavalry in the valley where Joseph’s brethren were feeding their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
flocks when they sold him to the wandering Ishmaelites. Here
they remained to gather some tidings of the operations of
their fellow-soldiers on the other side of the Jordan, and then
proceeded to ravage and lay waste all the country between
Naplous and Jerusalem, “continuing,” says Abbot Coggleshale,
“both by night and by day to slaughter every living thing that
they met.”</p>

<p>The column which was to proceed through the valley of the
Jordan, entered the great plain of Esdraelon by Mount Thabor,
and taking the direction of Nain and Endor to Jezreel, they
crossed the mountains of Gilboa to Beisan, and descended the
valley of the Jordan, as far as Jericho. Thence they proceeded
to lay siege to a solitary castle of the Templars, seated upon that
celebrated mountain where, according to tradition, our Saviour
was tempted by the Devil with the visionary scene of “all the
kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them.” In this castle
the Templars maintained a garrison, for the protection of the
pilgrims who came to bathe in the Jordan, and visit the holy
places in the neighbourhood of Jericho. From the toppling
crag, whereon it was seated, the eye commanded an extensive
view of the course of the Jordan, until it falls into the Dead Sea,
also of the eastern frontier of the Latin kingdom, and of the
important passes communicating with Jerusalem. The place
was called <i>Maledoim</i>, or “the Red Mountain,” on account of the
blood that had been shed upon the spot. Fifty Tyrian dinars
had been offered by Saladin, for the head of every Knight Templar
that was brought him, and the blood-thirsty infidels surrounded
the doomed castle eager for the reward. The whole
garrison was put to the sword, and the place was left a shapeless
ruin. The infidels then marched off in the direction of Jerusalem,
and laid waste all the country between Jericho and the
Holy City. They pitched their tents at Bethany, upon the spot
where stood the houses of Simon the leper, and of Mary Magdalene
and Martha, and they destroyed the church built over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
house and tomb of Lazarus. The wild Arab cavalry then swept
over the Mount of Olives; they took possession of the church
constructed upon the summit of that sacred edifice, and extended
their ravages up to the very gates of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>In the mean time Saladin’s valiant brother Saifeddin, “sword
of the faith,” had crossed the desert from Egypt, to participate
in the plunder and spoil of the christian territories. He laid
waste all the country from Daron and Gerar to Jerusalem. In
front of his fierce warriors were to be seen the long bands of
mournful captives tied together by the wrists, and behind them
was a dreary desert, soaked with christian blood. Saifeddin had
besieged the strong town of Mirabel, and placed his military
engines in position, when the terrified inhabitants sent a suppliant
deputation to implore his clemency. He agreed to spare
their lives in return for the immediate surrender of the place,
and gave them an escort of four hundred Mussulmen, to conduct
them in safety to Jerusalem. Accompanied by their wives and
little ones, the miserable Christians cast a last look upon their
once happy homes, and proceeded on their toilsome journey to
the Holy City. On their arrival at an eminence, two miles from
Jerusalem, their Arabian escort left them, and immediately afterwards
a party of Templars dashed through the ravine, charged
the retiring Moslems, and put the greater part of them to the
sword.</p>

<p>The great Saladin, on the other hand, immediately after the
battle of Tiberias, hastened with the main body of his forces to
Acre, and the terrified inhabitants threw open their gates at his
approach. From thence he swept the whole sea coast to Jaffa,
reducing all the maritime towns, excepting the city of Tyre,
which manfully resisted him. The savage Turcomans from the
north, the predatory Bedouins, the fanatical Arabians, and the
swarthy Africans, hurried across the frontiers, to share in the
spoil and plunder of the Latin kingdom. Radolph, our worthy
abbot of Coggleshale, one of those who fled before the ruthless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
swords of the infidels, gives a frightful picture of the aspect of
the country. He tells us that the whole land was covered with
dead bodies, rotting and putrifying in the scorching sun-beams.
At early morning you might see the rich and stately church,
with the bright and happy dwellings scattered around it, the
blooming garden, the silvery olive grove, and the rich vineyard;
but the fading rays of the evening sun would fall on smoking
masses of shapeless ruins, and on a dreary and solitary desert.
The holy abbot mourns over the fall of Nazareth, and the desecration
by the infidels of the magnificent church of the Holy
Virgin at that place. Sidon, Caiphas, Sepphoris, Nazareth,
Cæserea, Jaffa, Lidda, and Rama, successively fell into the hands
of the Moslems; the inhabitants were led away into captivity,
and the garrisons were put to the sword. The infidels laid
waste all the country about Mount Carmel and Caiphas, and
they burnt the celebrated church of Elias, on the mountain
above the port of Acre, which served as a beacon for navigators.</p>

<p>The government of the order of the Temple, in consequence
of the captivity of the Grand Master Gerard de Riderfort, who
was detained in prison, with Guy, king of Jerusalem, at Damascus,
devolved upon Brother Terric, the Grand Preceptor of
Jerusalem, who addressed letters to all the brethren in the west,
imploring aid and assistance. One of these letters was duly
received by Brother Geoffrey, Master of the Temple at London,
as follows:&mdash;“Brother Terric, Grand Preceptor of the poor
house of the Temple, and every poor brother, and the whole
convent, now, alas! almost annihilated, to all the preceptors and
brothers of the Temple, to whom these letters shall come, salvation
through him to whom our fervent aspirations are addressed,
through him who causeth the sun and the moon to reign marvellous.</p>

<p>“The many and great calamities wherewith the anger of God,
excited by our manifold sins, hath just now permitted us to be
afflicted, we cannot for grief unfold to you, neither by letters nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
by our sobbing speech. The infidel chiefs having collected together
a vast number of their people, fiercely invaded our Christian
territories, and we, assembling our battalions, hastened to
Tiberias to arrest their march. The enemy having hemmed us
in among barren rocks, fiercely attacked us; the holy cross and
the king himself fell into the hands of the infidels, the whole
army was cut to pieces, two hundred and thirty of our knights
were beheaded, without reckoning the sixty who were killed on
the 1st of May. The Lord Reginald of Sidon, the Lord Ballovius,
and we ourselves, escaped with vast difficulty from that
miserable field. The pagans, drunk with the blood of our
Christians, then marched with their whole army against the
city of Acre, and took it by storm. The city of Tyre is at present
fiercely besieged, and neither by night nor by day do the infidels
discontinue their furious assaults. So great is the multitude of
them, that they cover like ants the whole face of the country
from Tyre to Jerusalem, and even unto Gaza. The holy city of
Jerusalem, Ascalon, and Tyre, and Beyrout, are yet left to us
and to the christian cause, but the garrisons and the chief inhabitants
of these places, having perished in the battle of Tiberias,
we have no hope of retaining them without succour from
heaven and instant assistance from yourselves.”<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Saladin, on the
other hand, sent triumphant letters to the caliph. “God and his
<span class="small">ANGELS</span>,” says he, “have mercifully succoured <span class="smcap">Islam</span>. The infidels
have been sent to feed the <i>fires</i> of <span class="small">HELL</span>! The cross is
fallen into our hands, around which they fluttered like the moth
round a light; under whose shadow they assembled, in which
they boldly trusted as in a wall; the cross, the centre and leader
of their pride, their superstition, and their tyranny.”...</p>

<p>Saladin pursued his rapid conquests along the sea coast to the
north of Acre, and took by storm several castles of the Templars.
After a siege of six days, the strong fortress of Tebnin, on the
road to Beirout, was taken by assault, the garrison was put to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
the sword, and the fortifications were razed to the ground. On
the 22nd, Jomada, the important city of Beirout, surrendered to
Saladin, and shortly afterwards the castles of Hobeil and Bolerum.
The old chronicle published by Martene, has the following
strange passage concerning the last named castle. “To
this castle belonged the lady whom the count of Tripoli refused
to give up to Gerard de Riderfort, the Grand Master of the Temple,
whence arose the great quarrel between them, which caused the
loss of the Holy Land.” After the reduction of all the maritime
towns between Acre and Tripoli, Saladin ordered his different
detachments to concentrate before Jerusalem, and hastened in
person to the south to complete the conquest of the few places
which still resisted the arms of the Mussulmen. He sat down
before Ascalon, and whilst preparing his military engines for
battering the walls, he sent messengers to the Templars at Gaza,
representing to them that the whole land was in his power, that
all further efforts at resistance were useless, and offering them
their lives and a safe retreat to Europe, if they would give up to
him the important fortress committed to their charge. But the
military friars sent back a haughty defiance to the victorious
sultan, and recommended him to take Ascalon before he ventured
to ask for the surrender of Gaza. The season was now
advancing&mdash;vague rumours were flying about of stupendous preparations
in Europe for the recovery of Palestine, and Saladin
was anxious to besiege and take Jerusalem ere the winter’s rains
commenced. When, therefore, his military engines were planted
under the walls of Ascalon, he once more, as the place was
strong, summoned the inhabitants to surrender, and they then
agreed to capitulate on receiving a solemn promise from Saladin
that he would forthwith set at liberty the king of Jerusalem and
the Grand Master of the Temple, and would respect both the
persons and the property of the inhabitants. These terms were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
acceded to, and on the 4th of September the gates of Ascalon
were thrown open to the infidels.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>The inhabitants of this interesting city appear to have been
much attached to their king, Guy de Lusignan, and his queen
Sibylla. They had received them when they came from Jerusalem,
as fugitives from the wrath of Baldwin IV., and protected them
against the power of that monarch. The sultan imposed such conditions
upon the prisoners as were necessary for his own security.
They were to quit Palestine never more to return, and were in
the mean time, until a fitting opportunity for their embarkation
to Europe could be found, to take up their abode at Naplous,
under the surveillance of the Moslem garrison. Immediately
after the capture of Ascalon, Saladin pitched his tents beneath
the walls of Gaza, the great fortress of the Knights Templars.
He had been repulsed by the military friars with great loss in a
previous attack upon this important station, and he now surrounded
it with his numerous battalions, thirsting for vengeance.
The place surrendered after a short siege; the fortifications
were demolished, but the fate of the garrison has not been recorded.</p>

<p>Having subjugated all the country bordering upon the sea
coast, Saladin moved forward in great triumph towards the
sacred city of Jerusalem. He encamped the first night at Bersabee,
the ancient Beersheba, around the well digged by Abraham,
in the land of the Philistines, and on the spot where
Abraham delivered the seven ewe lambs, and made the covenant
with Abimelech, and planted a grove, and called “on the name
of the Lord, the everlasting God.” The next day Saladin
marched towards Bethlehem, halting on the way before a castle
of the Hospitallers, which he summoned to surrender, but in
vain. Leaving a party of horse to watch the place, he pitched
his tents the same evening around Bethlehem, and the next
morning at sunrise, the Moslem soldiers might be seen pouring
into the vast convent and the magnificent church erected by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
empress Helena and her son Constantine, over the sacred spot
where the Saviour of the world was born. They wandered with
unbounded admiration amid the unrivalled Corinthian colonnade,
formed by a quadruple row of forty ancient columns, which support
a barn-roof constructed of the cedar of Lebanon. They
paused to admire the beautiful mosaics which covered the lofty
walls, the richly carved screen on either side of the high altar,
and the twenty-five imperial eagles. Saladin was present in
person, and no serious disorders appear to have been committed.
The inhabitants of the town had all fled to Jerusalem, with whatever
property they could carry with them, and in the afternoon,
after establishing a garrison in the place, the sultan commenced
his march towards the Holy City.</p>

<p>At the hour of sunset, when the bells of the churches of Jerusalem
were tolling to vespers, the vast host of Saladin crowned
in dark array the bleak and desolate eminences which surround
the city of David. The air was rent with the loud Mussulman
shouts <i>El Kods, El Kods</i>&mdash;“The Holy City, the Holy City!” and
the green and yellow banners of the prophet, and the various
coloured emblems of the Arabian tribes, were to be seen standing
out in bold relief upon the lofty ridges of the hills, and
gleaming brightly in the last trembling rays of the setting sun.
The Arabian writers descant with enthusiasm upon the feelings
experienced by their countrymen on beholding “the long lost
sister of Mecca and Medina,” on gazing once more upon the
swelling domes of the Mosque of Omar, and on the sacred eminence
from whence, according to their traditions, “Mahomet
ascended from earth to heaven.” It must have been, indeed, a
strange, and an awful scene. The Moslem host took up their
stations around the Holy City at the very hour when the followers
both of the Christian and Mahometan religion were wont
to assemble to offer up their prayers to the one Great God, the
common Father of us all. On the one hand, you might hear
the sound of the sweet vesper bells from the towers of the Chris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>tian
churches wafted softly upon the evening breeze, the hoarse
chant of the monks and priests, and the loud swelling hymn of
praise; while on the other, over all the hills and eminences
around Jerusalem, stole the long shrill cry of the muezzins, loudly
summoning the faithful to their evening devotions. Within the
walls, for one night at least, the name of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> was invoked with
true piety and fervent devotion; while without the city, the eternal
truth and the Moslem fiction were loudly proclaimed, “There
is but one <span class="smcap">God</span>, and <i>Mahomet</i> is his apostle.”</p>

<p>That very night, when the Mussulmen had finished their
prayers, and ere darkness spread its sable shroud over the land,
the loud trumpets of Saladin summoned the Christians to surrender
“the house of God” to the arms of the faithful: but the
Christians returned for answer, that, please God, the Holy City
should <i>not</i> be surrendered. The next morning at sunrise, the
terrified inhabitants were awakened by the clangour of horns
and drums, the loud clash of arms, and the fierce cries of the
remorseless foe. The women and children rushed into the
churches, and threw themselves on their knees before the altars,
weeping and wailing, and lifting up their hands to heaven,
whilst the men hastened to man the battlements. The Temple
could no longer furnish its hundreds and thousands of brave
warriors for the defence of the holy sanctuary of the Christians;
a few miserable knights, with some serving brethren, alone
remained in its now silent halls and deserted courts. For fifteen
days did the Christians successfully resist the utmost efforts of
the enemy; the monks and the canons, the bishops and the
priests, took arms in defence of the Holy Sepulchre, and lined
in warlike array the dark gray battlements and towers of Jerusalem.
But the Mussulman archers soon became so numerous
and so expert, that the garrison durst not show themselves upon
the walls “Their arrows fell,” says our worthy countryman,
abbot Coggleshale, one of the brave defenders of the place, “as
thick as hail upon the battlements, so that no one could lift a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
finger above the walls without being maimed. So great indeed
was the number of the wounded, that it was as much as all the
doctors of the city and of the Hospital could do to extract the
weapons from their bodies. The face of the narrator of these
events was lacerated with an arrow which pierced right through
his nose; the wooden shaft was withdrawn, but a piece of the
iron head remains there to this day.”<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>Jerusalem was crowded with fugitives who had been driven
into the Holy City from the provinces. The houses could not
contain them, and the streets were filled with women and children,
who slept night after night upon the cold pavement. At
the expiration of a fortnight, Saladin finding his incessant attacks
continually foiled, retired from the walls, and employed
his troops in the construction of military engines, stationing ten
thousand cavalry around the city to intercept fugitives, and prevent
the introduction of supplies. When his engines were completed,
he directed all his efforts against the northern wall of the
city, which extends between St. Stephen’s gate and the gate of
Jaffa. Ten thousand soldiers were attached to the military engines,
and were employed day and night in battering the fortifications.
Barefoot processions of women, monks, and priests
were made to the holy sepulchre, to implore the Son of God to
save his tomb and his inheritance from impious violation. The
females, as a mark of humility and distress, cut off their hair and
cast it to the winds; and the ladies of Jerusalem made their
daughters do penance by standing up to their necks in tubs of
cold water placed upon Mount Calvary. But it availed nought,
“for our Lord Jesus Christ,” says the chronicler, “would not
listen to any prayer that they made, for the filth, the luxury, and
the adultery which prevailed in the city did not suffer prayer
or supplication to ascend before God.”</p>

<p>To prevent the garrison from attempting to break the force
of the battering-rams, Saladin constructed vast mangonels and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
machines, which cast enormous stones and flaming beams of timber,
covered with pitch and naptha, upon the ramparts, and over
the walls into the city. He moreover employed miners to sap
the foundations of the towers, and on the 16th of October the
angle of the northern wall, where it touches the valley of Gehinnon,
was thrown down with a tremendous crash. The appalling
intelligence spread through the city, and filled every heart
with mourning. Friends embraced one another as it were for
the last time; mothers clung to their little ones, anticipating
with heart-rending agony the fearful moment when they would
be torn from them for ever; and the men gazed around in
gloomy silence, appalled and stupified. Young mothers might
be seen carrying their babes in their arms to Mount Calvary, and
placing them before the altars of the church of the Resurrection,
as if they thought that the sweet innocence of these helpless objects
would appease the wrath of heaven. The panic-stricken
garrison deserted the fortifications, but the infidels fortunately
deferred the assault until the succeeding morning. During the
night attempts were made, but in vain, to organize a strong
guard to watch the breach. “With my own ears,” says abbot
Coggleshale, “I heard it proclaimed, between the wall and the
counterscarp, by the patriarch and the chief men of the city, that
if fifty strong and valiant foot soldiers would undertake to guard
for one night only the angle which had been overthrown, they
should receive fifty golden bezants; but none could be found to
undertake the duty.”</p>

<p>In the morning a suppliant deputation proceeded to Saladin
to implore his mercy, but ere they reached the imperial tent the
assault had commenced, and twelve banners of the prophet
waved in triumph upon the breach. The haughty sultan accordingly
refused to hear the messengers, and dismissed them,
declaring that he would take Jerusalem from the Franks as they
had taken it from the Moslems, that is say, <i>sword in hand</i>. But
some spirit of resistance had at last been infused into the quail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>ing
garrison, the few Templars and Hospitallers in Jerusalem
manned the breach, and in a desperate struggle the Moslems
were repulsed, and the standards of the prophet were torn down
from the walls. The messengers then returned to Saladin, and
declared that if he refused to treat for the surrender of Jerusalem,
the Christians would set fire to the <span class="smcap">Temple</span> or Mosque of
Omar, would destroy all the treasures they possessed in the city,
and massacre their Moslem prisoners. The announcement of
this desperate determination, which was accompanied with the
offer of a very considerable ransom, induced Saladin to listen to
terms, and a treaty was entered into with the Christians to the
following effect. The Moslems were immediately to be put into
possession of all the gates of Jerusalem, and the liberty and
security of the inhabitants were to be purchased in the following
manner. Every man was to pay to Saladin ten golden bezants
as a ransom, every woman five, and every child under seven years
was to pay one bezant.</p>

<p>When these terms, so disgraceful to the christian negotiators,
were known in the Holy City, nothing could exceed the
grief and indignation of the poorer classes of people, who had
no money wherewith to pay the ransom, and had consequently
been delivered up to perpetual bondage by their richer <i>christian</i>
brethren. All resistance on their part, however, to the treaty
was then hopeless; the poor had been betrayed by the rich; the
infidels were already in possession of the tower of David, and
their spears were gleaming in the streets of the Holy City. It is
recorded to the praise of the few Templars and Hospitallers who
were then in Jerusalem, that they spent all the money they possessed
in ransoming their poor christian brethren, whom they
escorted in safety to Tripoli. The number of those who, being
unable to pay the ransom, were reduced to a state of hopeless
slavery, is estimated at fourteen thousand, men, women, and
children. They were sold in the common slave-markets, and
distributed through all the Mussulman countries of Asia. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
women became the concubines and the handmaids of their masters,
and the children were educated in the Mohammedan faith.</p>

<p>The Arabian writers express their astonishment at the number
of the christian captives, and give a heart-rending account of their
sorrows and misfortunes. One of them tells us that he saw in
his native village a fair European woman, bright as the morning
star, who had two beautiful children. She seldom spoke, but
remained the live-long day absorbed in melancholy contemplation;
there was, says he, such a sweetness and gentleness in her
deportment, that it made one’s heart ache to see her. “When
I was at Aleppo,” says the historian, Azz’eddin Ali Ibn-Al’atsyr,
who fought in Saladin’s army, and was present at the battle of
Tiberias, “I had for a slave one of the christian women taken at
Jaffa. She had with her a little child, about a year old, and
many a bitter tear did she shed over this tender infant. I did
my best to comfort her, but she exclaimed, ‘Alas, sir, it is not
for this child that I weep; I had a husband and two sisters, and
I know not what has become of them. I had also six brothers,
all of whom have perished.’ This is the case of one person
only. Another day I saw at Aleppo a christian slave accompanying
her master to the house of a neighbour. The master
knocked at the door, and another Frank woman came to open it;
the two females immediately give a loud cry; they rush into
each other’s arms; they weep; they sit down on the ground and
enter into conversation. They were two sisters who had been
sold as slaves to different masters, and had been brought without
knowing it to the same town.”<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>Thus fell the holy city of Jerusalem, eighty-eight years after
its conquest by Godfrey de Bouillon and the crusaders. Our
excellent chronicler, Radolph, abbot of Coggleshale, who was
redeemed from bondage by payment of the ten golden bezants,
throws a pitying glance upon the misfortunes and miseries of
the poor captives, but attributes the fall of Jerusalem, and all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
calamities consequent thereon, to the sins and iniquities of the
inhabitants. “They honoured God,” says he, “with their lips,
but their hearts were far from him.” He speaks of the beautiful
women who thronged Jerusalem, and of the general corruption
of the city, and exclaims, in the words of the prophet, “The
Lord hath said unto the heathen, Go ye up against her walls
and destroy, take away her battlements, for they are not the
Lord’s.”</p>

<p>Immediately after the surrender of the city (October 11, <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span>
1187) the Moslems rushed to the <span class="smcap">Temple</span> (Templum Domini,
ante <a href="#Page_12">p. 12</a>) in thousands. “The imauns and the doctors and
expounders of the wicked errors of Mahomet,” says Abbot Coggleshale,
“first ascended to the Temple of the Lord, called by
the infidels <i>Beit Allah</i>, (the house of God,) in which, as a place
of prayer and religion, they place their great hope of salvation.
With horrible bellowings they proclaimed the law of Mahomet,
and vociferated, with polluted lips, <span class="smcap">Allah</span> <i>acbar</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Allah</span> <i>acbar</i>
(<span class="smcap">God</span> is victorious). They defiled all the places that are contained
within the Temple; i. e. the place of the presentation,
where the mother and glorious Virgin Mary delivered the Son of
God into the hands of the just Simeon; and the place of the
confession, looking towards the porch of Solomon, where the
Lord judged the woman taken in adultery. They placed guards
that no Christian might enter within the seven atria of the Temple;
and as a disgrace to the Christians, with vast clamour, with
laughter and with mockery, they hurled down the golden cross
from the pinnacle of the building, and dragged it with ropes
throughout the city, amid the exulting shouts of the infidels
and the tears and lamentations of the followers of Christ.” When
every Christian had been removed from the precincts of the
Temple, Saladin proceeded with vast pomp to say his prayers in
the <i>Beit Allah</i>, the holy house of God, or “Temple of the Lord,”
erected by the Caliph Omar. He was preceded by five camels
laden with rose-water, which he had procured from Damascus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
and he entered the sacred courts to the sound of martial music,
and with his banners streaming in the wind. The <i>Beit Allah</i>,
“the Temple of the Lord,” was then again consecrated to the
service of one God and his prophet Mahomet; the walls and
pavements were washed and purified with rose-water; and a
pulpit, the labour of Noureddin, was erected in the sanctuary.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>The following account of these transactions was forwarded to
Henry the Second, king of England. “To the beloved Lord
Henry, by the grace of God, the illustrious king of the English,
duke of Normandy and Guienne, and count of Anjou, Brother
Terric, formerly Grand Preceptor of the house of the Temple at
<span class="smcap">Jerusalem</span>, sendeth greeting,&mdash;salvation through him who saveth
kings. Know that Jerusalem, with the citadel of David, hath
been surrendered to Saladin. The Syrian Christians, however,
have the custody of the holy sepulchre up to the fourth day after
Michaelmas, and Saladin himself hath permitted ten of the
brethren of the Hospital to remain in the house of the hospital
for the space of one year, to take care of the sick.... Jerusalem,
alas, hath fallen; Saladin hath caused the cross to be thrown
down from the summit of the Temple of the Lord, and for two
days to be publicly kicked and dragged in the dirt through the
city. He then caused the Temple of the Lord to be washed
within and without, upwards and downwards, with rose-water,
and the law of Mahomet to be proclaimed throughout the four
quarters of the Temple with wonderful clamour....”<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>Bohadin, Saladin’s secretary, mentions as a remarkable and
happy circumstance, that the holy city was surrendered to the
sultan of most pious memory, and that God restored to the
faithful their sanctuary on the 27th of the month Regeb, on
the night of which very day their most glorious prophet
Mahomet performed his wonderful nocturnal journey from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
Temple of the Lord, through the seven heavens, to the throne of
God. He also describes the sacred congregation of the Mussulmen
gathered together in the Temple and the solemn prayer
offered up to God; the shouting and the sounds of applause, and
the voices lifted up to heaven, causing the holy buildings to resound
with thanks and praises to the most bountiful Lord God.
He glories in the casting down of the golden cross, and exults in
the very splendid triumph of Islam. Saladin restored the sacred
area of the Temple to its original condition under the first Mussulman
conquerors of Jerusalem (ante, <a href="#Page_12">p. 12</a>). The ancient
christian church of the Virgin (the mosque <i>Al Acsa</i>, and “Temple
of Solomon”) was washed with rose-water, and was once again dedicated
to the religious services of the Moslems. On the western
side of this venerable edifice the Templars had erected, according
to the Arabian writers, an immense building in which they
lodged, together with granaries of corn and various offices, which
enclosed and concealed a great portion of the edifice. Most of
these were pulled down by the sultan to make a clear and open
area for the resort of the Mussulmen to prayer. Some new erections
placed between the columns in the interior of the structure
were taken away, and the floor was covered with the richest carpets.
“Lamps innumerable,” says Ibn Alatsyr, “were suspended
from the ceiling; verses of the Koran were again inscribed
on the walls; the call to prayer was again heard; the
bells were silenced; the exiled faith returned to its ancient
sanctuary; the devout Mussulmen again bent the knee in adoration
of the one only God, and the voice of the imaun was again
heard from the pulpit, reminding the true believers of the resurrection
and the last judgment.”<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>The Friday after the surrender of the city, the army of Saladin,
and crowds of true believers, who had flocked to Jerusalem
from all parts of the East, assembled in the Temple of the Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
to assist in the religious services of the Mussulman sabbath.
Omad, Saladin’s secretary, who was present, gives the following
interesting account of the ceremony, and of the sermon that was
preached. “On Friday morning at daybreak,” says he, “everybody
was asking whom the sultan had appointed to preach. The
Temple was full; the congregation was impatient; all eyes were
fixed on the pulpit; the ears were on the stretch; our hearts
beat fast, and tears trickled down our faces. On all sides were
to be heard rapturous exclamations of ‘What a glorious sight!
What a congregation! Happy are those who have lived to see
the resurrection of <span class="smcap">Islam</span>.’ At length the sultan ordered the
judge (doctor of the law) <i>Mohieddin Aboulmehali-Mohammed</i> to
fulfil the sacred function of imaun. I immediately lent him the
black vestment which I had received as a present from the caliph.
He then mounted into the pulpit and spoke. All were hushed.
His expressions were graceful and easy, and his discourse was
eloquent and much admired. He displayed the virtue and sanctity
of Jerusalem; he spoke of the purification of the Temple;
he alluded to the silence of the bells, and to the flight of the
infidel priests. In his prayer he named the caliph and the
sultan, and terminated his discourse with that chapter of the
Koran in which God orders justice and good works. He then
descended from the pulpit, and prayed in the Mihrab. Immediately
afterwards a sermon was preached before the congregation.”</p>

<p>This sermon was delivered by <i>Mohammed Ben Zeky</i>. “Praise
be to God,” saith the preacher, “who by the power of his might
hath raised up Islamism on the ruins of polytheism; who governs
all things according to his will; who overthroweth the
devices of the infidels, and causeth the <span class="small">TRUTH</span> to triumph! I
praise God, who hath succoured his elect, who hath rendered
them victorious and crowned them with glory, who hath purified
his holy house from the filthiness of idolatry.... I bear
witness that there is no God but that one great God who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
standeth <i>alone</i> and hath no <span class="small">PARTNER</span>; sole, supreme, eternal;
who begetteth not and is not begotten, and hath <span class="small">NO EQUAL</span>. I
bear witness that Mahomet is his servant, his envoy, and his
prophet, who hath dissipated doubts, confounded polytheism, and
put down <span class="small">LIES</span>! O men, declare ye the blessings of God, who
hath restored to you this holy city, after it has been left in the
power of the infidels for a hundred years. This <span class="small">HOLY HOUSE</span> of
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath been built, and its foundations have been established,
for the glory of God. This sacred spot is the dwelling-place
of the prophets, the <i>kebla</i> (place of prayer) towards which
you turn at the commencement of your religious duties, the
birth-place of the saints, the scene of the revelation. It is thrice
holy, for the angels of God spread their wings over it. This is
that blessed land of which God hath spoken in his sacred book.
In this house of prayer, Mahomet prayed with the angels who
approach God. It is to this spot that all fingers are turned after
the two holy places. This conquest, O men, hath opened unto
you the gates of heaven; the angels rejoice, and the eyes of the
prophets glisten with joy.” The preacher proceeds, in a high
strain of enthusiasm, to enlarge upon the merits of the holy war.
“The holy war, the holy war!” says he, “is better than religious
worship; it is the noblest of your occupations. Aid God, and
he will assist you; protect the Lord, and he will protect you;
remember him, and he will have you in remembrance; do good
to him, and he will do good to you. Cut off the branches of iniquity;
purify the earth from unbelievers, and destroy the nations
who have excited the wrath of God and his apostle, &amp;c....”<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>Omad informs us that the marble altar and chapel which had
been erected over the sacred rock in the Temple of the Lord, or
Mosque of Omar, was removed by Saladin, together with the
stalls for the priests, the marble statues, and all the abominations
which had been placed in the venerated building by the Christians.
The Mussulmen discovered with horror that some pieces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
of the holy stone or rock had been cut off by the Franks, and
sent to Europe. Saladin caused it to be immediately surrounded
by a grate of iron. He washed it with rose-water, and Malek-Afdel
covered it with magnificent carpets. Saladin, in his famous
letter to the caliph, giving an account of the conquest of Jerusalem,
exclaims&mdash;“God hath at length turned towards the supporters
of the true faith; he hath let loose his wrath against the
infidels, and hath driven them from his sanctuary.... The
infidels have erected churches in the holy city, and the great
houses of the Templars and Hospitallers. In these structures
are rich marbles and many precious things. Thy servant hath
restored the Mosque Al-Acsa (the Temple of the Knights Templars,
ante <a href="#Page_12">p. 12</a>) to its ancient destination. He hath appointed
imauns to celebrate divine service, and on the 14th chaaban they
preached, the <i>khotbeh</i> (sermon). The heavens are rent with joy
and the stars dance with delight. The word of God hath been
exalted, and the tombs of the prophets, which the infidel hath
defiled, have been purified.”<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Saladin restored the fortifications
of Jerusalem; he founded several schools, and converted the
great house of the Hospitallers into a college. He then quitted
the Holy City to pursue his military operations in the field.</p>

<p>The Templars still maintained themselves in some of the
strongest castles of Palestine, and the maritime city of Tyre continued
to resist all the attacks of the Moslems. This important
sea-port was preserved to the Christians by the valour and
military talents of the young Conrad, marquis of Montferrat,
who digged a ditch across the isthmus which connects Tyre with
the main land, repaired the fortifications and planted catapults
and balistæ in boats, so as to command the only approach to
the town. Saladin proceeded in person to Tyre, to conduct the
operations against this important place. He was on horseback
from morn till night, and was assisted by his sons, his
brother, and his nephew, all of whom commanded in the field<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
under the eye of the sultan, and animated the troops by their
example. The following account of the state of affairs in Palestine
is contained in a letter from Brother Terric, Grand Preceptor of
the Temple, and Treasurer General of the order, to Henry the
Second, king of England. “The brothers of the hospital of Belvoir
as yet bravely resist the Saracens; they have captured two convoys,
and have valiantly possessed themselves of the munitions of war
and provisions which were being conveyed by the Saracens from
the fortress of La Feue. As yet, also, Carach, in the neighbourhood
of Mount Royal, Mount Royal itself, the Temple of Saphet,
the hospital of Carach, Margat, and Castellum Blancum, and the
territory of Tripoli, and the territory of Antioch, resist Saladin....
From the feast of Saint Martin, up to that of the circumcision
of the Lord, Saladin hath besieged Tyre incessantly, by
night and by day, throwing into it immense stones from thirteen
military engines. On the vigils of St. Silvester, the Lord Conrad,
the marquis of Montferrat, distributed knights and foot soldiers
along the wall of the city, and having armed seventeen
galleys and ten small vessels, with the assistance of the house of
the Hospital and the brethren of the Temple, he engaged the
galleys of Saladin, and vanquishing them he captured eleven,
and took prisoners the great admiral of Alexandria and eight
other admirals, a multitude of the infidels being slain. The rest
of the Mussulman galleys, escaping the hands of the Christians,
fled to the army of Saladin, and being run aground by his command,
were set on fire and burnt to ashes. Saladin himself,
overwhelmed with grief, having <i>cut off the ears and the tail of his
horse</i>, rode that same horse through his whole army in the sight
of all. Farewell!”<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Tyre continued to be valiantly defended
until the winter had set in, and then the disappointed sultan,
despairing of taking the place, burnt his military engines and retired
to Damascus.</p>

<p>The king of Jerusalem, and the Grand Master of the Temple,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
who had, as before mentioned, been residing at Naplous, under
the surveillance of Saladin’s officers, were now set at full liberty,
pursuant to the treaty of Ascalon, on the understanding that they
would immediately proceed to Tyre and embark for Europe.
Queen Sibylla, who was in Jerusalem at the time of its surrender
to Saladin, had been permitted to join her royal husband at
Naplous, and the king, the queen, and the Grand Master of the
Temple, consequently proceeded together to Tyre. On their
arrival at that place, they found the gates shut against them.
The young Conrad declared, that as the city had been preserved
solely by the swords of himself and his followers, it justly belonged
to him, and that neither the king nor the queen of Jerusalem
any longer possessed authority within it. Cruelly repelled
from Tyre, the king and queen, with their infant children, the
Grand Master of the Temple, and the patriarch Heraclius, proceeded
to Antioch.</p>

<p>As soon as the winter rains had subsided, Saladin took the
field, and attempted to reduce various strong castles of the Templars
and Hospitallers. The most formidable of these were the
castles of Saphet and Kowkab (the star); the one belonging to
the order of the Temple, and the other to the order of the
Hospital of Saint John. Saphet is one of the four holy cities
of the Talmud, and is held in peculiar veneration by the Jews.
The castle of the Templars crowned the summit of a lofty
mountain, along the sides of which extended the houses and
churches of the town. It was the strongest fortress possessed
by the order in Palestine. From the ramparts the eye ranged
over a rich prospect of luxuriant vineyards and smiling villages,
and embraced a grand panoramic view of lofty mountains.
Through the valley below rolled the Jordan; to the southward
extended the vast blue expanse of the lake of Tiberias; and in the
north-east the snowy summits of Anti-Lebanon might be seen
piercing the skies. This important fortress commanded the
greater part of Galilee; it had always been a great check upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
the incursions of the infidels, and was considered one of the bulwarks
of the Latin kingdom. Saladin’s exertions, consequently,
for the capture of the place were strenuous and incessant. He
planted a large body of troops around it, under the command of
his brother Saifeddin; but the season was not far enough
advanced for their operations to be carried on with any chance
of success. The tents of the besiegers were blown off the mountain
by the furious whirlwinds, and the operation of the military
engines was impeded by heavy rains. The Templars made continued
sallies upon the works, burnt the military engines,
butchered the soldiers in their sleep, and harassed them with
incessant alarms in the dead of night. The siege was consequently
turned into a blockade, and Saladin drew off the greater
part of his forces to attack the Christian possessions in the principality
of Antioch. He divided his army into several detachments,
which were sent in different directions, with orders to
ravage all the neighbouring country, drive away the oxen, sheep,
and cattle, and collect the booty together in the plain of the
Orontes, along the banks of the lake of Kades. He crossed the
vast mountain ranges which extend between the Orontes and
the sea-coast, and appeared in arms before the gates of Tripoli.
Strenuous preparations had been made to receive him, and the
sultan contented himself with reconnoitering the place and
examining its defences; having done which, he directed his
march upon Tortosa. The Grand Master of the Temple, who
was anxiously watching Saladin’s movements, immediately threw
himself into the strong castle of the Templars at that place, and
prepared to defend the town; but the fortifications were weak,
the inhabitants were panic-stricken, and the Templars, after a
short struggle, were compelled to abandon the city, and retire
behind their fortifications. There they maintained a fierce and
bloody contest with the Moslems, and during the various assaults
and sallies the town was set on fire and burnt to the ground.
Bohadin gives a fearful account of the destruction by fire of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
great cathedral church, and of the roaring and crackling of the
flames as they burst through the huge cedar beams and timbers
of the roof. He says that thousands of faithful Mussulmen
gathered around the vast and venerable pile, and raised exulting
shouts as they witnessed the progress of the fire, lifting up their
voices to heaven, and returning thanks to the most bountiful
Lord God!</p>

<p>Having failed in all his attempts to take the castle of the
Templars, Saladin drew off his forces, leaving the once populous
and flourishing town of Tortosa a dreary desert. He then besieged
and took the city of Gabala, and then approached in warlike
array the far-famed Laodicea. The panic-stricken inhabitants
refused to defend the town, and abandoned the fortifications,
but some Templars and other knights, throwing
themselves into the citadel with their followers, boldly resisted
the attacks of the infidels. After a desperate defence a capitulation
was signed, the garrison marched out with all the honours
of war, and the banners of Islam were then planted upon the
towers and battlements. Both Ibn Alatsyr and Bohadin give an
enthusiastic description of the town and its environs. They
speak of its noble harbour, its beautiful houses, elegant villas,
rich marbles, luxuriant gardens, and shady groves. All these
became the prey of the fierce Mussulman soldiery, who committed
great excesses. They broke to pieces the choice specimens
of ancient sculpture, considering them hated evidences of
idolatry; they stripped all the churches of their ornaments, and
sold the sacred vestments of the priests. From Laodicea,
Saladin marched to Sohioun or Sekyun, a fortress of prodigious
strength, situate amongst the mountains midway between Gabala
and the Orontes. It was almost entirely surrounded by a deep
precipitous ravine, the sides of which were in many places perpendicular.
After a siege of five days, a part of the Mussulman
soldiers clambered over some rocks which were thought to be
inaccessible, climbed the outer wall of the town, and opened the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
gates to their companions; the second and third walls were
then carried by assault, and the citadel surrendered after a short
siege. Many other important cities and castles speedily fell
into the hands of the victorious Saladin. Among these were
the city of Bakas, or Bacas, on the banks of the Orontes, and
the castle of Al Shokhr, which was connected with the town by
a bridge over the river; the castle of Al Jahmàhûnîn, near
Gabala; Blatanous, near Antioch; Sarminiah, or Sarmaniya, a
fortress, a day’s journey N. E. of Aleppo; and many other
places of note. All the towns and castles between Sarminiah
and Gabala surrendered to the Moslems. “Glory be to God,”
says Ibn Alatsyr, “who hath made easy that which appeared to
be difficult.”</p>

<p>Saladin then recrossed the Orontes, and laid siege to Berzyeh,
or Borzya, a fortress which commanded the high road from
Antioch to Emesa, or Hems, and was, therefore, a place of very
great importance. During a very hot day, when the garrison
had been fighting from sunrise till noon, Saladin suddenly
called up his reserve, placed himself at their head, scaled the
fortifications, and entered the town sword in hand. The houses
were set on fire, the streets were drenched with blood, and all
the inhabitants who escaped the general massacre, were made
slaves. From Berzyeh, Saladin marched down the vast and
fertile plain of the Orontes, to the famous iron bridge over that
river, about six or seven miles from Antioch, with a view of besieging
the strong castle of the Knights Templars, called Derbazâc,
or Darbêsak. On the 8th Regeb, having collected his forces together,
and procured a vast number of powerful military engines,
he moved forward and invested the place. The walls were
surrounded with wooden towers, filled with expert archers, who
swept the battlements with their arrows. Under cover of these
towers, battering-rams were placed in position, and a vast breach
was made in the walls. Saladin’s body-guard moved forward to
the assault, supported by crowds of archers on either flank, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
the Templars filled up the breach with their bodies, and after a
bloody contest the Mussulmen were driven back, leaving the
ground covered with their dead. The Templars repaired the
breach, and the sultan shifted his ground of attack. Hurdles
covered with raw hides were advanced against the walls, and an
expert party of miners were employed, under cover of these
hurdles, to undermine a huge tower, which was considered to
be the key of the fortifications. The tower was so well and
strongly built, that it resisted for a length of time all the efforts
of the miners; they dug away a great part of the foundations,
and the tower appeared, says Ibn Alatsyr, to be suspended in
the air. At last, however, it fell with a tremendous crash, carrying
along with it into the ditch a vast portion of the walls on either
side, so that a large yawning gap was opened in the fortifications.
Again the Mussulmen rushed to the assault with loud shouts,
and again they were hurled back by the stout arms of the
Templars, leaving the heaps of stone, and the vast masses of
shattered walls around them, crimsoned with the blood of their
best men. Bohadin, who witnessed the assault, declares that
he never saw such an obstinate defence. As soon as any one of
the Templars fell, another, he tells us, would immediately take
his place, and thus they remained upon the breach immoveable
as a rock. At last, it was agreed that if the fortress was not
succoured by the prince of Antioch, within a given period, the
Templars should surrender it, and march out with their arms in
their hands. No succour arrived by the appointed time, and the
place was consequently given up to the Mussulmen.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>Immediately after the surrender of Darbêsak, Saladin marched
upon Bagras, a town situate at the foot of Mount Al Locam, and
pushed on his advanced guard to the environs of the vast and
populous city of Antioch, but he contented himself with the
mere sight of the place, and declined to undertake the siege of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
it. He remained for some time in observation before the city,
and sent out detachments in different directions to lay waste the
surrounding country, and collect spoil. The population of Antioch
was estimated at 150,000 souls: nearly all the surviving
Templars of the principality were collected together within the
walls, under the command of their valiant Grand Master, and
the Prince Bohemond was at the head of a numerous and well-organized
force, fully prepared for a desperate struggle in defence
of his rich and princely city. Saladin consequently preferred
entering into a truce to continuing the war, and concluded
a treaty with Bohemond, whereby a suspension of arms was
agreed upon for the term of eight months, to commence from
the first of the approaching month of November, and it was
stipulated that all the Moslem prisoners detained in Antioch
should be set at liberty. Saladin then returned by the valley of
the Orontes to Damascus, and his troops became very impatient
to be dismissed to their homes for the winter, but he reminded
them of the brevity and uncertainty of human life, told them
that there was plenty of work before them, and that they ought
not to leave for to-morrow that which could be done to-day. He
accordingly set out from Damascus at the head of a large body
of forces, and proceeded to lay siege to Saphet, the strong and
important castle of the Knights Templars. Bohadin accompanied
the sultan, and gives an interesting account of his incessant
exertions for the capture of the place. During a windy and
tempestuous night, he superintended the planting of five besieging
engines. To every soldier he allotted a specific task,
and turning to his secretary he said, “Let us not go to bed to-night,
until these five engines are completed.” Every now and
then messengers came in to narrate the progress of the work,
and Saladin spent the intermediate time in cheerful converse
with his friend. The night was dark and long, the weather
miserably wet and cold, and the ground covered with mud.
Bohadin ventured to address some observations to his royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
master, upon the imprudence of exposing himself to the inclemency
of the season, and to so much watching and fatigue,
but the pious sultan reminded him of the words of the prophet,
“The fire of hell shall not prevail against the eye that wakes
and watches in the service of God, and the eye that weeps
through fear of God.”</p>

<p>The Templars manfully defended themselves, and their brethren
in Tyre made an attempt to send them succour. Two
hundred valiant and determined soldiers set out from that city,
and marched through the country by night, sheltering themselves
in the day-time in caverns and solitary places amongst the
mountains. They reached Saphet, and attempted to conceal
themselves in the neighbourhood of the castle, until they could
find an opportunity of communicating with their beleaguered
brethren. Unfortunately one of their number strayed from his
place of concealment, and was seen by a Mussulman emir, who
immediately called out a strong guard, searched the neighbourhood,
and took the whole party prisoners. They were brought
into Saladin’s presence and condemned to death; but before
the sentence was carried into execution negotiations were entered
into for the surrender of Saphet. The Templars in the
fortress were ill provided with provisions; they had now lost all
hope of succour, and they agreed to surrender, on condition that
they should be permitted to march out with their arms to Tyre,
in company with the prisoners whom Saladin had just taken.
These terms were acceded to, and the fortifications of the strong
castle of Saphet were speedily demolished by the infidels.<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>In the mean time all Europe had been thrown into consternation
by the dismal intelligence of the fall of Jerusalem.
Public prayers were put up in the churches, and fasts were
ordered, as in times of great national calamities. Pope Urban
III. is said to have died of grief, and the cardinals made a solemn
resolution to renounce all kinds of diversions and pleasures, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
receive no presents from any one who had causes depending in
the court of Rome, and never to mount a horse as long as the
Holy Land was trodden under foot by the infidels. Pope Gregory
VIII. addressed apostolical letters to the sovereigns,
bishops, nobles, and people of all christian countries, painting
in pathetic terms the miserable disasters of the Latin Christians,
the capture of the holy cross, the slaughter of the Templars and
Hospitallers, and the fall of Jerusalem, and exhorting all faithful
Christians immediately to assume the cross, and march to the
deliverance of the Holy City. Crowds of armed pilgrims again
quitted the shores of Europe for Palestine, and the Templars,
obedient to the pressing calls of their brethren, hurried from
their preceptories to the seaports of the Mediterranean, and
embarked in the ships of Genoa, Pisa, and Venice. The Grand
Master of the Temple, and the king of Jerusalem, placed themselves
at the head of the newly arrived battalions, and established
their head quarters at Ras el Ain, a small village on the main
land opposite Tyre. Many valiant Templars from the Temple
at London, and the different preceptories of England, Scotland,
and Ireland, joined their chief, and brought with them arms,
horses, clothing, and munitions of war, with a vast amount of
treasure, which had been collected in the churches. They were
the bearers likewise of a large sum of money which had been
sent by king Henry the Second for the defence of Tyre. This
money was delivered to the Grand Master, but as the siege of
Tyre had been raised before its arrival, and the young Conrad
claimed the sovereignty of the city, and set up his authority in
opposition to that of the king of Jerusalem, Gerard de Riderfort
very properly refused to deliver the money into his hands;
whereupon Conrad wrote letters filled with bitter complaints to
the archbishop of Canterbury and to king Henry.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>At the commencement of the summer, the king and the Grand
Master took the field at the head of an army of 9,000 men, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
marched along the coast with the intention of laying siege to
the important city of Acre. Saladin wrote to all the governors
of the Moslem provinces, requiring them to join him without
delay, and directed his army to concentrate at Sepphoris. From
thence he marched to Keruba, and then moved in order of battle
to Tel Kaisan, where the plain of Acre begins. The city of
Acre had been regularly invested for some days previous to his
arrival, and after reconnoitering the position of the christian
army, he encamped, extending his left wing to Al Nahr Al Halu,
“the sweet river,” and his right to Tel Al’Ayâdhiya, in such a
manner, that the besiegers themselves became the besieged. He
then made a sudden attack upon the weakest part of the christian
camp, broke through the lines, penetrated to the gate of
Acre, called Karàkûsh, which he entered, and threw into the city
a reinforcement of 5,000 warriors, laden with arms, provisions,
clothing, and everything necessary for the defence of the place.
Having accomplished this bold feat, Saladin made a masterly retreat
to his camp at Tel Al’Ayâdhiya.</p>

<p>On the 4th of October, the newly-arrived warriors from
Europe, eager to signalize their prowess against the infidels,
marched out of their intrenchments to attack Saladin’s camp.
The holy gospels, wrapped in silk, were borne by four knights
on a cushion, before the king of Jerusalem, and the patriarch
Heraclius and the western bishops appeared at the head of the
christian forces with crucifixes in their hands, exhorting them
to obtain the crown of martyrdom in defence of the christian
faith. The Templars marched in the van, and led the assault;
they broke through the right wing of the Mussulman army,
which was commanded by Saladin’s nephew, and struck such
terror into the hearts of the Moslems, that some of them fled,
without halting, as far as Tiberias. The undisciplined masses
of the christian army, however, thinking that the day was their
own, rushed heedlessly on after the infidels, and penetrating to
the imperial tent, abandoned themselves to pillage. The Grand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
Master of the Temple, foreseeing the result, collected his
knights and the forces of the order around him. The infidels
rallied, they were led on by Saladin in person, and the Christian
army would have been annihilated but for the Templars. Firm
and immoveable, they presented for the space of an hour an
unbroken front to the advancing Moslems, and gave time for
the discomfited and panic-stricken crusaders to recover from
their terror and confusion; but ere they had been rallied, and
had returned to the charge, the Grand Master Gerard de Riderfort,
was slain; he fell, pierced with arrows, at the head of his
knights, the seneschal of the order shared the same fate, and
more than half the Templars were numbered with the dead.<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>To Gerard de Riderfort succeeded (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1189) the Knight
Templar, Brother <span class="smcap">Walter</span>.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Never did the flame of enthusiasm
burn with fiercer or more destructive power than at this famous
siege of Acre. Nine pitched battles were fought, with various
fortune, in the neighbourhood of Mount Carmel, and during the
first year of the siege a hundred thousand Christians are computed
to have perished. The tents of the dead, however, were
replenished by new-comers from Europe; the fleets of Saladin
succoured the town, the Christian ships brought continual aid
to the besiegers, and the contest seemed interminable. Saladin’s
exertions in the cause of the prophet were incessant. The Arab
authors compare him to a mother wandering with desperation
in search of her lost child, to a lioness who has lost its young.
“I saw him,” says his secretary Bohadin, “in the fields of Acre
afflicted with a most cruel disease, with boils from the middle
of his body to his knees, so that he could not sit down, but only
recline on his side when he entered into his tent, yet he went
about to the stations nearest to the enemy, arranged his troops
for battle, and rode about from dawn till eve, now to the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
wing, then to the left, and then to the centre, patiently enduring
the severity of his pain.” Having received intelligence of the
mighty preparations which were being made in Europe for the
recovery of Jerusalem, and of the march of the emperor Frederick
Barbarossa through Hungary and Greece to Constantinople,
with a view of crossing the Hellespont, into Asia, Saladin sent
orders to the governors of Senjâr, Al Jazîra, Al Mawsel, and
Arbel, ordering them to attend him with their troops, and directed
his secretary Bohadin to proceed to the caliph Al Nâssr
Deldin’illah, at Bagdad, humbly to request the Mussulman
pontiff to use his spiritual authority and influence to induce all
the Moslem nations and tribes to heal their private differences
and animosities, and combine together against the Franks, for
the defence of Islam. Bohadin was received with the greatest
distinction and respect by the caliph and the whole divan at
Bagdad, and whilst the pope was disseminating his apostolical
letters throughout Christendom, calling upon the western nations
to combine together for the triumph of the <span class="small">CROSS</span>, the Mussulman
pontiff was addressing, from the distant city of Bagdad, his
pious exhortations to all true believers, to assemble under the
holy banners of the prophet, and shed their blood in defence of
<i>Islam</i>.</p>

<p>Shortly after the commencement of the new year, (586, Hejir
which began Feb. 9th, <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1190,) Saladin collected his troops
together, to raise the siege of Acre. He moved from Al Kherûba
to Tel Al Ajûl, where he pitched his camp. He was there joined
by his son Al Malek, Al Daher Gayâtho’ddîn Gâzi, the governor
of Aleppo, with a select body of cavalry, and by Mohaffero’ddîn
I’Bn Zinoddin, with his light horse. The Templars and the
crusaders, during the winter, had not been idle; they had dug
trenches around their camp, thrown up ramparts, and fortified
their position in such a way that it would have been difficult,
says the Arabian writer, for even a bird to get in. They had,
moreover, filled up the ditch around the town, and constructed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
three enormous towers, the largest of which was much higher
than the walls, was sixty cubits in length, and could contain
from five to six hundred warriors, with a proper quantity of arms
and military engines. These towers were covered with the raw
hides of oxen soaked in vinegar and mud, to render them incombustible;
they were strengthened from top to bottom with
bands of iron, and were each divided into five platforms or galleries
filled with soldiers and military engines. They were rolled
on wheels to the walls, and the Templars and the crusaders
were about to descend from the platforms and galleries upon the
battlements of the city, when the towers, and all the warriors
upon them, were consumed by some inextinguishable inflammable
composition, discharged out of brass pots by a brazier from
Damascus. “We were watching,” says Bohadin, who was standing
in the Moslem camp by Saladin’s side, “with intense anxiety
the movements of the soldiers upon the towers, and thought that
the city must inevitably be taken, when suddenly we saw one of
them surrounded with a blaze of light, which shot up into the
skies; the heavens were rent with one joyous burst of acclamation
from the sons of Islam, and in another instant another
tower was surrounded with raging flames and clouds of black
smoke, and then the third; they were ignited one after the
other in the most astonishing and surprising manner, with
scarce an interval of a minute between them. The sultan immediately
mounted his horse, and ordered the trumpets to
sound to arms, exclaiming with a loud voice, in the words of the
prophet, ‘When the gate of good fortune is thrown open, delay
not to enter in.’”</p>

<p>At the commencement of the summer Saladin detached a
considerable portion of his forces to the north, to oppose the
progress of the German crusaders and Templars, who were
advancing from Constantinople, under the command of the
emperor Frederic Barbarossa. These advancing Templars were
the especial favourites of Barbarossa, and after his melancholy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
death, from the effects of a cold bath in the river Cydnus, they
formed part of the body-guard of his son the duke of Suabia.</p>

<p>In the month of July the Templars suffered severe loss in
another attack upon Saladin’s camp. The christian soldiery,
deceived by the flight of the Mussulmen, were again lured to
the pillage of their tents, and again defeated by the main body
of Saladin’s army, which had been posted in reserve. The
Templars were surrounded by an overpowering force, but they
fought their way through the dense ranks of the infidels to their
own camp, leaving the plain of Acre strewed with the lifeless
bodies of the best and bravest of their warriors. “The enemies
of God,” says Bohadin, “had the audacity to enter within the
camp of the lions of Islamism, but they speedily experienced
the terrible effects of the divine indignation. They fell beneath
the sabres of the Mussulmen as the leaves fall from the trees
during the tempests of autumn. Their mangled corpses, scattered
over the mountain side, covered the earth even as the
branches and boughs cover the hills and valleys when the
woodsman lops the forest timber.” “They fell,” says another
Arabian historian, “beneath the swords of the sons of Islam as
the wicked will fall, at the last day, into the everlasting <i>fire</i> of
<span class="small">HELL</span>. Nine rows of the dead covered the earth between the
sea-shore and the mountains, and in each row might be counted
the lifeless bodies of at least one thousand warriors.”</p>

<p>The Moslem garrison continued manfully to defend the town;
they kept up a constant communication with Saladin, partly by
pigeons, partly by swimmers, and partly by men in small skiffs,
who traversed the port in secresy, by favour of the night, and
stole into the city. At one period the besieged had consumed
nearly all their provisions, and were on the point of dying with
famine, when Saladin hit upon the following stratagem, for the
purpose of sending them a supply. He collected together a
number of vessels at Beirout laden with sacks of meal, cheese,
onions, sheep, rice, and other provisions. He disguised the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
seamen in the Frank habit, put crosses on their pendants, and
covered the decks of the vessels with hogs. In this way the
little fleet sailed safely through the blockading squadron of the
Christians, and entered the port of Acre. On another occasion
Saladin sent 1,000 <i>dinars</i> to the garrison, by means of a famous
diver named Isa; the man was unfortunately drowned during
his passage to the city, but the money, being deposited in three
bladders, tied to his body, was a few days afterwards thrown
ashore near the town, and reached the besieged in safety. At
the commencement of the winter the garrison was again reduced
to great straits for want of food, and was on the point of surrendering,
when three vessels from Egypt broke through the guard-ships
of the Christians, and got safely into the harbour with a
copious supply of provisions, munitions of war, and everything
requisite to enable the city to hold out until the ensuing
spring.</p>

<p>To prevent the further introduction of succours by sea, the
crusaders endeavoured to take possession of the tower of Flies,
a strong castle, built upon a rock in the midst of the sea at the
mouth of the harbour, which commanded the port. The Templars
employed one of their galleys upon this service, and
crowds of small boats, filled with armed men, military engines,
and scaling-ladders, were brought against the little fortress, but
without effect. The boats and vessels were set on fire by the
besieged and reduced to ashes, and after losing all their men,
the Christians gave over the attempt. On the land side, the
combats and skirmishes continued to be incessant. Wooden
towers, and vast military machines, and engines, were constantly
erected by the besiegers, and as constantly destroyed by the
sallies and skilful contrivances of the besieged. The Templars,
on one occasion, constructed two battering machines of a new
invention, and most enormous size, and began therewith furiously
to batter the walls of the town, but the garrison soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
destroyed them with fire-darts, and beams of timber, pointed
with red-hot iron.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>At the commencement of the next year, (587, Hejir. which
began Jan. 29th, <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1191,) a tremendous tempest scattered the
fleet of the crusaders, and compelled their ships to take refuge
in Tyre. The sea being open, Saladin hastily collected some
vessels at Caiphas, threw a fresh body of troops into Acre, and
withdrew the exhausted garrison, which had already sustained
so many hardships and fatigues in defence of the town. This
exchange of the garrison was most happily timed, for almost
immediately after it had been effected, the walls of the city were
breached, and preparations were made for an assault. The
newly-arrived troops, however, repulsed the assailants, repaired
the walls, and once more placed the city in a good posture of
defence. The scarcity and famine in the christian camp continued
to increase, and a vast many of the crusaders, utterly
unable to withstand the hardships and difficulties of their position,
deserted to Saladin, embraced the Mohammedan faith, and
were employed by him, at their own request, in cruising off the
coast against their quondam friends. Bohadin tells us that
they met with vast success in their employment. On board one
of their prizes was found a silver table, and a great deal of
money and plate, which the captors brought to the sultan, the
13th Dhu’lhajja, but Saladin returned the treasure to them,
saying, that it was a sufficient satisfaction to him and the
Moslems, to see that the Franks pillaged and plundered one
another with such alacrity.</p>

<p>Famine and disease continued to make frightful ravages
amongst the crusaders. The duke of Suabia, Baldwin, archbishop
of Canterbury, the patriarch Heraclius, four archbishops,
twelve bishops, forty counts, and five hundred other nobles and
knights, besides common soldiers, fell victims to the malady.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
From two to three hundred persons died daily, and the survivors
became unequal to the task of burying the dead. The
trenches which the Christians had dug for their protection, now
became their graves. Putrefying corpses were to be seen floating
upon the sea, and lining the sea-shore, and the air was
infected with an appalling and intolerable effluvia. The bodies
of the living became bloated and swollen, and the most trifling
wounds were incurable. In addition to all this, numbers of the
poorer class of people died daily from starvation. The rich
supported themselves for a time upon horse-flesh, and Abbot
Coggleshale tells us, that a dinner off the entrails of a horse
cost 10<i>d.</i> Bones were ground to powder, mixed with water,
and eagerly devoured, and all the shoes, bridles, and saddles,
and old leather in the camp, were boiled to shreds, and greedily
eaten.</p>

<p>Queen Sibylla, who appears to have been sincerely attached
to the unpopular husband she had raised to the throne, was
present in the christian camp with four infant daughters. She
had wandered with the king, Guy de Lusignan, from one place
to another, ever since his liberation from captivity, and had
been his constant companion through all the horrors, trials, and
anxieties of the long siege of Acre. Her delicate frame, weakened
by sorrow and misfortune, was unable to contend with the
many hardships and privations of the christian camp. She fell
a victim to the frightful epidemic which raged amongst the
soldiers, and her death was speedily followed by that of her
four children. The enemies of the king now maintained that
the crown of the Latin kingdom had descended upon Isabella,
the younger sister of Sibylla, and wife of Humphrey de Thoron,
Lord of Montreal, or Mount Royal; but the latter seemed to
think otherwise, and took no steps either to have his wife made
queen, or himself king. The enterprising and ambitious
Conrad, Marquis of Montferrat, accordingly determined to play
a bold game for the advancement of his own fortunes. He paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
his addresses to Isabella, and induced her to consent to be
divorced from Humphrey de Thoron, and take him for her
husband. He went to the bishop of Beauvais, and persuaded
that prelate to pronounce the divorce, and immediately after it
had been done, he carried off Isabella to Acre, and there married
her. As soon as the nuptials had been performed, Conrad
caused himself and his wife to be proclaimed king and queen
of Jerusalem, and forthwith entered upon the exercise of certain
royal functions. He went to the christian camp before Acre,
and his presence caused serious divisions and dissensions
amongst the crusaders. The king, Guy de Lusignan, stood
upon his rights; he maintained that, as he had been once a
king, he was always a king, and that the death of his wife could
not deprive him of the crown which he had solemnly received,
according to the established usage of the Latin kingdom. A
strong party in the camp declared themselves in his favour, and
an equally strong party declared in favour of his rival, Conrad,
who prepared to maintain his rights, sword in hand. The misfortunes
of the Christians appeared, consequently, to have approached
their climax. The sword, the famine, and the pestilence,
had successively invaded their camp, and now the demon
of discord came to set them one against the other, and to paralyse
all their exertions in the christian cause.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p class="p2">In the mean time the crusade continued to be preached with
great success in Europe. William, archbishop of Tyre, had proceeded
to the courts of France and England, and had represented
in glowing colours the miserable condition of Palestine,
and the horrors and abominations which had been committed
by the infidels in the holy city of Jerusalem. The English and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
French monarchs laid aside their private animosities, and agreed
to fight under the same banner against the infidels, and towards
the close of the month of May, in the second year of the siege
of Acre, the royal fleets of Philip Augustus and Richard Cœur
de Lion floated in triumph in the bay of Acre. The Templars
had again lost their Grand Master, and Brother Robert de Sablè,
or Sabloil, a valiant knight of the order, who had commanded a
division of the English fleet on the voyage out, was placed
(<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1191) at the head of the fraternity.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> The Templars performed
prodigies of valour; “Their name and reputation, and
the fame of their sanctity,” says James of Vitry, bishop of Acre,
“like a chamber of perfume sending forth a sweet odour, were
diffused throughout the entire world, and all the congregation
of the saints will recount their battles and glorious triumphs
over the enemies of Christ; knights, indeed, from all parts of
the earth, dukes, and princes, after their example, casting off
the shackles of the world, and renouncing the pomps and
vanities of this life, for Christ’s sake, hastened to join them,
and to participate in their holy profession and religion.” They
carried before them, at this time, to battle, “a bipartite banner of
black and white, which they call <i>beauseant</i>, that is to say, in the
Gallic tongue, <i>bienseant</i>, because they are fair and favourable to
the friends of Christ, but black and terrible to his enemies.”<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>Saladin had passed the winter on the heights of Schaferan
and Keruba. His vast army had been thinned and weakened by
incessant watching, by disease, and continual battles, and he
himself was gradually sinking under the effects of a dreadful
disease, which baffled all the skill of his medical attendants, and
was gradually drawing him towards the grave. But the proud
soul of the great chieftain never quailed; nor were his fire and
energy at any time deadened. As soon as he heard of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
arrival of the two powerful christian monarchs, he sent envoys
and messengers throughout all Mussulman countries, earnestly
demanding succour, and on the Mussulman sabbath, after
prayers had been offered up to God for the triumph of his arms,
and the deliverance of Islam, he caused to be read, in all the
mosques letters to the following effect;&mdash;</p>

<p>“In the name of <span class="smcap">God</span>, the most <span class="small">MERCIFUL</span> and <span class="small">COMPASSIONATE</span>.
To all devout Believers in the one only God, and his
prophet Mahomet, our Master. The armies of the infidels,
numerous as the stars of heaven, have come forth from the remote
countries situate beyond Constantinople, to wrest from us
those conquests which have gladdened the hearts of all who put
their trust in the Koran, and to dispute with us the possession
of that holy territory whereon the Caliph Omar, in bygone days,
planted the sacred standard of the Prophet. O men, prepare ye
to sacrifice your lives and fortunes in defence of <i>Islam</i>. Your
marches against the infidels, the dangers you encounter, the
wounds you receive, and every minute action, down to the fording
of a river, are they not written in the book of God? Thirst,
hunger, fatigue, and death, will they not obtain for you the everlasting
treasures of heaven, and open to your gaze the delicious
groves and gardens of Paradise? In whatsoever place ye remain,
O men, death hath dominion over you, and neither your
houses, your lands, your wives, your children, nor the strongest
towers, can defend you from his darts. Some of you, doubtless,
have said one to another, Let us not go up to fight during the
heat of summer; and others have exclaimed, Let us remain at
home until the snow hath melted away from the mountain tops;
but is not the fire of hell more terrible than the heats of summer,
and are not its torments more insupportable than the
winter’s cold? Fear <span class="smcap">God</span>, and not the <i>infidels</i>; hearken to the
voice of your chief, for it is Saladin himself who calls you to
rally around the standard of <i>Islam</i>. If you obey not, your
families will be driven out of Syria, and God will put in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
places a people better than you. <span class="smcap">Jerusalem</span>, the holy, the
sister of Medina and Mecca, will again fall into the power of
the idolaters, who assign to God a son, and raise up an equal
to the Most High. Arm yourselves then, with the buckler and
the lance, scatter these children of fire, the wicked sons of hell,
whom the sea hath vomited forth upon our shores, repeating to
yourselves these words of the Koran, ‘He who abandoneth his
home and family to defend our holy religion, shall be rewarded
with happiness, and with many friends.’”<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>The siege of Acre was now pressed with great vigour; the
combined fleets of France and England completely deprived the
city of all supplies by sea, and the garrison was reduced to great
straits. The sultan despaired of being able to save the city,
and was sick, Bohadin tells us, both in mind and body. He
could neither eat nor drink. At night he would lie down upon
the side of the hill Aladajia, and indulge in some broken
slumbers, but at morning’s dawn he was on horseback, ordering
his brazen drum to be sounded, and collecting his army together
in battle array. At last letters were received, by means of
pigeons, announcing that the garrison could hold out no longer.
“Saladin gazed,” says Bohadin, “long and earnestly at the city,
his eyes were suffused with tears, and he sorrowfully exclaimed,
‘<i>Alas for Islam!</i>’” On the morning of the 12th of July, (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span>
1191,) the kings of France and England, the christian chieftains,
and the Turkish emirs with their green banners, assembled in
the tent of the Grand Master of the Temple, to treat for the
surrender of Acre; and on the following day the gates were
thrown open to the exulting warriors of the cross. The Templars
took possession of their ancient quarters by the side of the sea,
and mounted a large red-cross banner upon the tower of the
Temple. They possessed themselves of three extensive localities
along the sea-shore, and the Temple at Acre from thenceforth
became the chief house of the order. Richard Cœur de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
Lion took up his abode with the Templars whilst Philip Augustus
resided in the citadel.</p>

<p>By the terms of the surrender of Acre, the inhabitants were
to pay a ransom of two hundred thousand pieces of gold for
their lives and liberties; two thousand noble and five hundred
inferior christian captives were to be set at liberty, and the true
cross, which had been taken at the battle of Tiberias, was to be
restored to the Latin clergy. Two months were accorded for
the performance of these conditions. I’Bn Alatsyr, who was
then in Saladin’s camp, tells us that Saladin had collected together
100,000 pieces of gold, that he was ready to deliver up the
two thousand five hundred christian captives, and restore the
true cross, but his Mamlook emirs advised him not to trust
implicitly to the good faith of the christian adventurers of
Europe for the performance of their part of the treaty, but to
obtain from the Templars, of whose <i>regard for their word, and
reverence for the sanctity of an oath</i>, the Moslems had, he tells us,
a high opinion, a solemn undertaking for the performance, by
the Christians, of the stipulations they had entered into.
Saladin accordingly sent to the Grand Master of the Temple,
to know if the Templars would guarantee the surrender to him
of all the Moslem prisoners, if the money, the christian captives,
and the true cross, were sent to them; but the Grand Master
declined giving any guarantee of the kind. The doubts about the
agreement, and the delay in the execution of it, kindled the fierce
indignation of the English monarch, and Richard Cœur de Lion
led out all his prisoners, 2,000 in number, into the plain of
Acre, and caused them all to be beheaded in sight of the sultan’s
camp!<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> During his voyage from Messina to Acre, king Richard
had revenged himself on Isaac Comnenus, the ruler of the island
of Cyprus, for an insult offered to the beautiful Berengaria,
princess of Navarre, his betrothed bride. He had disembarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
his troops, stormed the town of Limisso, and conquered the
whole island; and shortly after his arrival at Acre he sold it to
the Templars for 300,000 livres d’or.<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>On the 21st of August, (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1191,) the Templars joined the
standard of king Richard, and left Acre for the purpose of marching
upon Jerusalem, by way of the sea-coast. They crossed the
river Belus, and pitched their tents on its banks, where they remained
for three days, to collect all the troops together. The
most copious and authentic account of their famous march by the
side of the king of England, through the hostile territories of the
infidels, is contained in the history of king Richard’s campaign,
by Geoffrey de Vinisauf, who accompanied the crusaders on their
expedition, and was an actor in the stirring events he describes.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
On Sunday, the 25th of August, the Templars, under the conduct
of their Grand Master, and the crusaders, under the command
of king Richard, commenced their march towards Cæsarea.
The army was separated into three divisions, the first of which
was led by the Templars, and the last by the Hospitallers.
The baggage moved on the right of the army, between the line
of march and the sea, and the fleet, loaded with provisions,
kept pace with the movements of the forces, and furnished them
daily with the necessary supplies. Saladin, at the head of an
immense force, exerted all his energies to oppose their progress,
and the march to Jaffa formed one perpetual battle. Vast
masses of cavalry hovered upon their flanks, cut off all stragglers,
and put every prisoner that they took to death. The first
night after leaving the Belus, the Templars and the crusaders
encamped along the banks of the brook Kishon, around some
wells in the plain between Acre and Caiphas. The next day
they forded the brook, fought their way to Caiphas, and there
halted for one day, in order that the reluctant crusaders, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
were lingering behind at Acre, might come on and join them.
On Wednesday, September 28, at dawn of day, they prepared to
force the passes and defiles of Mount Carmel. All the heights
were covered with dense masses of Mussulmen, who disputed
the ground inch by inch. The Templars placed themselves in
the van of the christian army, and headed the leading column,
whilst the cavalry of the Hospitallers protected the rear. They
ascended the heights through a dense vegetation of dry thistles,
wild vines, and prickly shrubs, drove the infidels before them,
crossed the summit of Mount Carmel, and descending into the
opposite plain, encamped for the night at the pass by the sea-shore,
called “the narrow way,” about eight miles from Caiphas.
Here they recovered possession of a solitary tower, perched
upon a rock overhanging the pass, which had been formerly
built by the Templars, but had for some time past been in the
hands of the Saracens. After lingering at this place an entire
day, waiting the arrival of the fleet and the barges, laden with
provisions, they recommenced their march (Friday, the 13th of
August) to Tortura, the ancient Dora, about seven miles distant.
The Grand Master of the Temple, and his valiant
knights, were, as usual, in the van, forcing a passage through
the dense masses of the Moslems. The country in every direction
around their line of march, was laid waste, and every day the
attacks became more daring. The military friars had hitherto
borne the brunt of the affray, but on the march to Tortura, they
suffered such heavy loss, that king Richard determined the next
day to take the command of the van in person, and he directed
them to bring up the rear.</p>

<p>On the fifth day from their leaving the river Belus, the Templars
and the crusaders approached the far-famed Cæsarea,
where St. Paul so long resided, and where he uttered his eloquent
oration before king Agrippa and Felix. But the town
was no longer visible; the walls, the towers, the houses, and all
the public buildings, had been destroyed by command of Sa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>ladin,
and the place was left deserted and desolate. The Templars
pitched their tents on the banks of the Crocodile river, the
<i>flumen crocodilon</i> of Pliny, having been five days in performing
the journey from the river Belus, a distance of only thirty-six
miles. The army halted at Cæsarea during the whole of Sunday,
the 1st of September, and high mass was celebrated by the
clergy with great pomp and solemnity, amid the ruins of the
city. On Monday, the 2nd of September, the tents of the Templars
were struck at morning’s dawn, and they commenced their
march, with the leading division of the army, for the city of Jaffa,
which is about thirty miles distant from Cæsarea. They forded
the Crocodile river, and proceeded on their journey through a
long and narrow valley, torn by torrents, and filled with vast
masses of rock, which had been washed down from the heights
by the winter rains. They had the sea on their right, and on
their left, a chain of craggy eminences. Every advantage was
taken by the enemy of the irregularity of the ground; the Mussulman
archers lined the heights, and vast masses of cavalry
were brought into action, wherever the nature of the country
admitted of their employment. The christian warriors were
encumbered with their heavy armour and military accoutrements,
which were totally unfit for the burning climate, yet
they enthusiastically toiled on, perseveringly overcoming all
obstacles.</p>

<p>Bohadin speaks with admiration of the valiant and martial
bearing of the warriors of the cross, and of their fortitude and
patient endurance during the long and trying march from Acre
to Jaffa. “On the sixth day,” says he, “the sultan rose at
dawn as usual, and heard from his brother that the enemy were
in motion. They had slept that night in suitable places about
Cæsarea, and were now dressing and taking their food. A
second messenger announced that they had begun their march;
our brazen drum was sounded, all were alert, the sultan came
out, and I accompanied him: he surrounded them with chosen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
troops, and gave the signal for attack. The archers were drawn
out, and a heavy shower of arrows descended, still the enemy
advanced.... Their foot soldiers were covered with thick-strung
pieces of cloth, fastened together with rings, so as to
resemble coats of mail. I saw with my own eyes several who
had not one or two, but <i>ten darts sticking in their backs</i>! and yet
marched on with a calm and cheerful step, without any trepidation.
They had a division of infantry in reserve, to protect
those who were weary, and look after the baggage. When any
portion of their men became exhausted and gave way through
fatigue or wounds, this division advanced and supported them.
Their cavalry in the mean time kept together in close column,
and never moved away from the infantry, except when they
rushed to the charge. In vain did our troops attempt to lure
them away from the foot soldiers; they kept steadily together
in close order, protecting one another and slowly forcing their
way with wonderful perseverance.”</p>

<p>After a short march of only eight miles from Cæsarea, the
Templars pitched their tents on the banks of the Nahr al Kasab,
a small river, called by Geoffrey de Vinisauf “<i>the dead river</i>.”
Here they remained two nights, waiting for the fleet. On the
4th of September they resumed their march through a desert
country which had been laid waste in every direction by command
of Saladin. Finding their progress along the shore impeded
by the tangled thickets, they quitted the plain and traversed
the hills which run parallel with the sea. Their march
was harassed by incessant charges of cavalry. The Templars
brought up the rear of the army, and lost so many horses during
the day, that they were almost driven to despair. At nightfall
they descended to the beach, and encamped on the banks of a
salt creek, close by the village of Om Khaled, near the ruins of
the ancient Apollonias, having performed a march of five miles.
The next morning, being Thursday, the 5th of September, the
Templars set out at sunrise from the salt creek in battle array,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
having received intelligence that Saladin had prepared an ambuscade
in the neighbouring forest of Arsoof, and intended to
hazard a general engagement. Scouts were sent on into the
forest, who reported that the road was clear; and the whole
army, ascending a slight rising ground, penetrated through the
wood, and descended into the plain of Arsur or Arsoof.
Through the midst of this plain rolls a mountain torrent, which
takes its rise in the mountains of Ephraim, and on the opposite
side of the stream Saladin had drawn up his army in battle
array. The Templars encamped for the night on the right
bank of the stream, having during the day marched nine
miles.</p>

<p>On Saturday, the 7th of November, king Richard, having
completed all his arrangements for a general engagement, drew
up his army at dawn. The Templars again formed the first
division, and were the first to cross the mountain torrent, and
drive in Saladin’s advanced guard. They were followed by Guy,
king of Jerusalem, who was at the head of the division of
Poitou, and then by the main body of the army under the personal
conduct of king Richard. Geoffrey de Vinisauf tells us,
that on all sides, far as the eye could reach, from the sea-shore
to the mountains, nought was to be seen but a forest of spears,
above which waved banners and standards innumerable. The
wild Bedouins, the children of the desert, with skins blacker
than soot, mounted on their fleet Arab mares, coursed with the
rapidity of lightning over the vast plain, and darkened the air
with clouds of missiles. They advanced to the attack with
horrible screams and bellowings, which, with the deafening
noise of the trumpets, horns, cymbals, and brazen kettle-drums,
produced a clamour that resounded through the plain, and
would have drowned even the thunder of heaven. King Richard
received the attack in close and compact array, strict orders
having previously been given that all the soldiers should remain
on the defensive until two trumpets had been sounded in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
front, two in the centre, and two in the rear of the army, when
they were in their turn to become the assailants. The ferocious
Turks, the wild Bedouins, and the swarthy Æthiopians, gathered
around the advanced guard of the Templars, and kept up a distant
and harassing warfare with their bows and arrows, whilst
the swift cavalry of the Arabs dashed down upon the foot soldiers
as if about to overwhelm them, then suddenly checking
their horses, they wheeled off to the side, raising clouds of
smothering, suffocating dust, which oppressed and choked the
toiling warriors. The baggage moved on between the army and
the sea, and the Christians thus continued slowly to advance
under the scorching rays of an autumnal sun. “They moved,”
says Vinisauf, “inch by inch; it could not be called walking,
for they were pushing and hacking their way through an overpowering
crowd of resisting foes.” Emboldened by their passive
endurance, the Moslems approached nearer, and began to
ply their darts and lances. The Marshall of the Hospital then
charged at the head of his knights, without waiting for the
signal, and in an instant the action became general. The clash
of swords, the ringing of armour, and the clattering of iron
clubs and flails, as they descended upon the helmets and bucklers
of the European warriors, became mingled with the groans
of the dying, and with the fierce cries of the wild Bedouins.
Clouds of dust were driven up into the skies, and the plain
became covered with banners, lances, and all kinds of arms, and
with emblems of every colour and device, torn and broken, and
soiled with blood and dust. Cœur de Lion was to be seen
everywhere in the thickest of the fight, and after a long and
obstinate engagement the infidels were defeated; but amid the
disorder of his troops Saladin remained on the plain without
lowering his standard or suspending the sound of his brazen
kettle-drums; he rallied his forces, retired upon Ramleh, and
prepared to defend the mountain passes leading to Jerusalem.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
The Templars pushed on to Arsoof, and pitched their tents
before the gates of the town.</p>

<p>On Monday, September 9th, the christian forces moved on in
battle array to Jaffa, the ancient Joppa, about eight miles from
Arsoof. The Templars brought up the rear of the army; and
after marching about five miles, they reached the banks of the
Nahr el Arsoof, or river of Arsoof, which empties itself into the
sea, about three miles from Jaffa, and pitched their tents in a
beautiful olive grove on the sea-shore. Saladin laid waste all
the country around them, drove away the inhabitants, and carried
off all the cattle, corn, and provisions. The towns of Cæsarea,
Ramleh, Jaffa, Ascalon, and all the villages, had been set
on fire and burnt to ashes, and all the castles and fortresses
within reach of the crusading army were dismantled and destroyed.
Among these last were the castles of St. George,
Galatia, Blancheward, Beaumont, Belvoir, Toron, Arnald, Mirabel,
the castle of the plain, and many others. Every place,
indeed, of strength or refuge was utterly destroyed by command
of the inexorable Saladin. Bohadin tells us that the sultan
mourned grievously over the destruction of the fair and beautiful
city of Ascalon, saying to those around him, “By God, I would
sooner lose my sons than touch a stone of this goodly city, but
what God wills, and the good of Islam requires, must be done.”
The walls and fortifications of Ascalon were of great extent and
stupendous strength, and an army of thirty thousand men was
employed for fourteen days in the work of demolition. “The
weeping families were removed from their houses, amid the
most heart-rending confusion and misery,” says Bohadin, “that
I ever witnessed.” Thousands of men were employed in dashing
down the towers and the walls, and throwing the stones
into the ditches and into the adjoining sea, and thousands were
occupied in carrying away property and the contents of the
public granaries and magazines. But ere half the effects had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
been removed, the impatient sultan ordered the town to be set
on fire, “and soon,” says Bohadin, “the raging flames were to
be seen, tearing through the roofs, and curling around the
minarets of the mosques.” The great tower of the Hospitallers
was the only edifice that resisted the flames and the exertions
of the destroyers. It stood frowning in gloomy and solitary
magnificence over the wide extended scene of ruin. “We must
not depart,” said Saladin, “until yon lofty tower has been
brought low,” and he ordered it to be filled with combustibles
and set on fire. “It stood,” says Bohadin, “by the sea-side,
and was of amazing size and strength. I went into it, and examined
it. The walls and the foundations were so solid, and of
such immense width, that no battering machines could have
produced the slightest effect upon them.” Every heart was
filled with sorrow and mourning at the sight of the scorched
and blackened ruins of the once fair and beautiful Ascalon.
“The city,” says Bohadin, “was very elegant, and, in truth,
exquisitely beautiful; its stupendous fortifications and lofty
edifices possessed a majesty and grandeur which inspired one
with awe.”<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>Ascalon, once the proudest of the five satrapies of the lords
of the Philistines, is now uninhabited. The walls still lie
scattered in huge fragments along the sea-shore, mixed with
columns and broken pillars, which are wedged in among them,
and amid the confused heaps of ruin which mark the site of the
ancient city, not a single dwelling is now visible. “The king
shall perish from Gaza,” saith the prophet, “and <span class="smcap">Ascalon</span> shall
<i>not be inhabited</i>.”</p>

<p>On the 16th of October Cœur de Lion wrote a letter to
Saladin, exhorting him to put an end to the holy war; but he
demanded, as the price of peace, the restitution of Jerusalem, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
Palestine, and the true cross. “Jerusalem,” says the king, “we
consider to be the seat of our religion, and every one of us will
perish rather than abandon it. Do you restore to us the country
on this side Jordan, together with the holy cross, which is of
no value to you, being in your eyes a mere piece of wood, but
which we Christians prize greatly; we will then make peace,
and repose from our incessant toils.” “When the sultan,” says
Bohadin, who was himself a participator in the negotiation,
“had read this letter, he took counsel with his emirs, and sent
a reply to the following effect:&mdash;‘The Holy City is held in as
great reverence and estimation by the Moslems, as it is by you,
ay, and in much greater reverence. From thence did our prophet
Mahomet undertake his nocturnal journey to heaven, and
upon that holy spot have the angels and the prophets at different
periods been gathered together. Think not that we will
ever surrender it. Never would we be so unmindful of our
duty, and of that which it behoves us to do, as good Mussulmen.
As to the country you speak of, it hath belonged to us of old,
and if you took it from the Moslems when they were weak,
they have taken it from you now that they are strong, as they
have a right to do. You may continue the war, but God will
not give you a stone of the land as a possession, for he hath
given the country to the Moslems, to be by them plentifully and
bountifully enjoyed. As to the cross, the reverence you pay to
that bit of wood is a scandalous idolatry, disrespectful to the
Most High, and hateful in the sight of God. We will, therefore,
not give it to you, unless by so doing we can secure some
great and manifest advantage for Islam.’”</p>

<p>On the 15th of November, the Templars marched out of
Jaffa with king Richard and his army, and proceeded through
the plain towards Jerusalem. As they advanced, Saladin slowly
retired before them, laying waste the surrounding country, destroying
all the towns and villages, and removing the inhabitants.
Between noon and evening prayers, the sultan rode over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
to the city of Lidda, where St. Peter cured Æneas of the palsy,
and employed his army, and a number of christian slaves, in
the destruction of the noble cathedral church erected by Justinian,
and in the demolition of the town. He then fell back
with his army to Beitnubah, a small village seated upon an
eminence at the extremity of the plain of Ramleh, at the commencement
of the hill country of Judea, and there encamped.
“On Friday morning, at an early hour,” says Bohadin, “the
sultan mounted on horseback, and ordered me to accompany
him. The rain fell in torrents. We marched towards Jerusalem.
We dismounted at the monastery near the church of
the Resurrection, and Saladin remained there to pass the night.”
The next morning at dawn the sultan again mounted on horseback,
and rode round the walls of the Holy City. The whole
population, together with two thousand christian captives, had
for weeks past been diligently employed in the reparation and
reconstruction of the fortifications. Forty expert masons had
arrived from Mossul, together with engineers and artificers from
all the Mussulman countries of Asia. Two enormous towers
were constructed, new walls were built, ditches were hollowed
out of the rocks, and countless sums, says Bohadin, were spent
upon the undertaking. Saladin’s sons, his emirs, and his brother
Adel, were charged with the inspection of the works; and
the sultan himself was on horseback every morning from sunrise
to sunset, stimulating the exertions of the workmen.</p>

<p>Whilst Saladin was making these vigorous preparations for the
defence of Jerusalem, the Templars halted at Ramleh, the
ancient Arimathea, situate in the middle of the plain, about
nine miles from Jaffa, and lingered with the crusaders amid the
ruins of the place for six weeks. In one of their midnight
sallies they captured and brought into the camp more than two
hundred oxen. On New Year’s day, <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1192, they marched to
Beitnubah, and encamped at the entrance of the gorges and
defiles leading to the Holy City; but these defiles were guarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
by a powerful army under the personal command of Saladin,
and the warriors of the cross ventured not to penetrate them.
The weather became frightful; tempests of rain and hail,
thunder and lightning, succeeded one another without cessation;
the tents were torn to pieces by furious whirlwinds, and
all the provisions of the army were destroyed by the wet. Many
of the camels, horses, and beasts of burthen, perished from
fatigue and the inclemency of the weather, and orders were
given for a retrograde movement to the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>The Templars faithfully adhered to the standard of Cœur de
Lion, and marched with him from Jaffa along the sea-coast to
the ruins of Ascalon; but the other warriors, who owned no
allegiance to the sovereign of England, abandoned him. The
duke of Burgundy and the French proceeded to enjoy themselves
in the luxurious city of Acre: some of the crusaders
remained at Jaffa, and others went to Tyre and joined the rebellious
party of Conrad, marquis of Montferrat. During the
march from Jaffa to Ascalon, a distance of twenty-eight miles,
the Templars suffered great hardships from hail-storms and
terrific showers of rain and sleet; and on their arrival amid the
ruins of the once flourishing city, they were nearly starved, by
reason of the shipwreck of their vessels freighted with the
necessary supplies. They pitched their tents among the ruins
on the 20th of January, <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1192, and for eight days were compelled
to subsist on the scanty supply of food they had brought
with them from Jaffa. During the winter they assisted king
Richard in the reconstruction of the fortifications, and took an
active part in the capture of several convoys and caravans which
were traversing the adjoining desert from Egypt.</p>

<p>Whilst the Templars and the kings of England and Jerusalem
thus remained under tents or in the open fields planning
the overthrow and destruction of the infidels, Conrad, marquis
of Montferrat, the pretender to the throne of the Latin kingdom,
was traitorously intriguing with Saladin for the advance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>ment
of his own schemes of private ambition. He was supported
by the duke of Burgundy and the French, and was at the
head of a strong party who hated king Richard, and envied him
the fame of his military exploits. The marquis of Montferrat
went to Saladin’s camp. He offered, Bohadin tells us, to make
war upon king Richard, to attack the city of Acre, and join his
forces to those of the sultan, provided the latter would cede to
him the maritime towns of Tyre, Sidon, and Beirout, and all
the sea-coast between them; but before these traitorous designs
could be carried into execution, the marquis of Montferrat was
assassinated. Six days after his death, the fickle princess Isabella,
his wife, the younger sister of the late queen Isabella,
married Henry, count of Champagne, nephew of king Richard.
This nobleman possessed great influence in the councils of the
christian chieftains, and a general desire was manifested for his
recognition as <span class="small">KING</span> of <span class="smcap">Jerusalem</span>. The Templars accordingly
induced Guy de Lusignan to abdicate in favour of Isabella and
the count of Champagne, offering him as a recompense the
wealthy and important island of Cyprus, which had been ceded
to them, as before mentioned, by king Richard.</p>

<p>Cœur de Lion and the Templars remained encamped amid
the ruins of Ascalon, and employed themselves in intercepting
the caravans and convoys which were crossing the neighbouring
desert, from Egypt to Palestine, and succeeded in setting at
liberty many christian captives. The second Sunday after
Trinity, the tents were struck, and they once more resumed
their march, with the avowed intention of laying siege to the
Holy City. They again proceeded, by easy stages, across the
plain of Ramleh, and on the 11th of June, five days after they
had left Ascalon, they reached Beitnubah where they again
halted for the space of an entire month, under the pretence of
waiting for Henry, the new king of Jerusalem, and the forces
which were marching under his command from Tyre and Acre.
But the rugged mountains between Beitnubah and Jerusalem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
were the real cause of delay, and again presented a barrier to
their further progress. Saladin had fixed his station in the
Holy City, leaving the main body of his army encamped among
the mountains near Beitnubah. His Mamlooks appear to have
been somewhat daunted by the long continuance of the war, and
the persevering obstinacy of the Christians. They remembered
the bloody fate of their brethren at Acre, and pressed the sultan
to reserve <i>his</i> person and <i>their</i> courage for the future defence of
their religion and empire. Bohadin gives a curious account of
their misgivings and disinclination to stand a siege within the
walls of Jerusalem. He made an address to them at the request
of the sultan, and when he had ceased to speak, Saladin himself
arose. A profound silence reigned throughout the assembly,&mdash;“they
were as still as if <span class="small">BIRDS</span> <i>were sitting on their</i> <span class="small">HEADS</span>.” “Praise
be to God,” said Saladin, “and may his blessing rest upon our
Master, Mahomet, his prophet. Know ye not, O men, that ye
are the only army of <span class="smcap">Islam</span>, and its only defence. The lives
and fortunes and children of the Moslems are committed to
your protection. If ye now quail from the fight, (which God
avert,) the foe will roll up these countries as the angel of the
Lord rolls up the book in which the actions of men are written
down.” After an eloquent harangue from the sultan, Saifeddin
Meshtoob, and the Mamlooks exclaimed with one voice, “My
Lord, we are thy servants and slaves; we swear, by God, that
none of us will quit thee so long as we shall live.”<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> But the
anxiety of Saladin and the Mamlooks was speedily calmed by
the retreat of the christian soldiers who fell back upon the sea-coast
and their shipping. The health of king Richard and
of Saladin was in a declining state, they were mutually weary
of the war, and a treaty of peace was at last entered into between
the sultan, the king of England, Henry, king of Jerusalem, and
the Templars and Hospitallers, whereby it was stipulated that
the christian pilgrims should enjoy the privilege of visiting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
Holy City and the Holy Sepulchre without tribute or molestation;
that the cities of Tyre, Acre, and Jaffa, with all the sea-coast
between them, should belong to the Latins, but that the
fortifications recently erected at Ascalon should be demolished.
Immediately after the conclusion of peace, king Richard, being
anxious to take the shortest and speediest route to his dominions,
induced Robert de Sablè, the Grand Master of the
Temple, to place a galley of the order at his disposal, and it
was determined that, whilst the royal fleet pursued its course
with queen Berengaria through the Straits of Gibraltar to
Britain, Cœur de Lion himself, disguised in the habit of a
Knight Templar, should secretly embark and make for one of
the ports of the Adriatic. The plan was carried into effect on
the night of the 25th of October, and king Richard set sail,
accompanied by some attendants, and four trusty Templars.
The habit he had assumed, however, protected him not, as is
well known, from the cowardly vengeance of the base duke of
Austria.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>In the year 1194, Robert de Sablè, the Grand Master of the
Temple, was succeeded by Brother Gilbert Horal or Erail, who
had previously filled the high office of Grand Preceptor of
France.<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> The Templars, to retain and strengthen their dominion
in Palestine, commenced the erection of several strong
fortresses, the stupendous ruins of many of which remain to this
day. The most famous of these was the Pilgrim’s Castle, which
commanded the coast-road from Acre to Jerusalem. It derived
its name from a solitary tower erected by the early Templars to
protect the passage of the pilgrims through a dangerous pass in
the mountains bordering the sea-coast, and was commenced
shortly after the removal of the chief house of the order from
Jerusalem to Acre. A small promontory which juts out into the
sea a few miles below Mount Carmel, was converted into a for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>tified
camp. Two gigantic towers, a hundred feet in height and
seventy-four feet in width, were erected, together with enormous
bastions connected together by strong walls furnished with all
kinds of military engines. The vast inclosure contained a
palace for the use of the Grand Master and knights, a magnificent
church, houses and offices for the serving brethren and
hired soldiers, together with pasturages, vineyards, gardens,
orchards, and fishponds. On one side of the walls was the salt
sea, and on the other, within the camp, were delicious springs of
fresh water. The garrison amounted to four thousand men in
time of war.<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> Considerable remains of this famous fortress are
still visible on the coast, a few miles to the south of Acre. It is
still called by the Levantines, <i>Castel Pellegrino</i>. Pocock describes
it as “very magnificent, and so finely built, that it may be
reckoned one of the things that are best worth seeing in these
parts.” “It is encompassed,” says he, “with two walls fifteen
feet thick, the inner wall on the east side cannot be less than
forty feet high, and within it there appear to have been some
very grand apartments. The offices of the fortress seem to have
been at the west end, where I saw an oven fifteen feet in diameter.
In the castle there are remains of a fine lofty church of
ten sides, built in a light gothic taste: three chapels are built
to the three eastern sides, each of which consists of five sides,
excepting the opening to the church; in these it is probable the
three chief altars stood.” Irby and Mangles, referring at a subsequent
period to the ruins of the church, describe it as a double
hexagon, and state that the half then standing had six sides.
Below the cornice are human heads and heads of animals in alto
relievo, and the walls are adorned with a double line of arches
in the gothic style, the architecture light and elegant.</p>

<p>On the death of Saladin, (13th of March, <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1193,) the vast
and powerful empire that he had consolidated fell to pieces, the
title to the thrones of Syria and Egypt was disputed between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
brother and the sons of the deceased sultan; and the pope,
thinking that these dissensions presented a favourable opportunity
for the recovery of the Holy City, caused another (the
fourth) crusade to be preached. Two expeditions organized in
Germany proceeded to Palestine and insisted on the immediate
commencement of hostilities, in defiance of the truce. The
Templars and Hospitallers, and the Latin Christians, who were
in the enjoyment of profound peace under the faith of treaties,
insisted upon the impolicy and dishonesty of such a proceeding,
but were reproached with treachery and lukewarmness in the
christian cause; and the headstrong Germans sallying out of
Acre, committed some frightful ravages and atrocities upon the
Moslem territories. The infidels immediately rushed to arms;
their intestine dissensions were at once healed, their chiefs extended
to one another the hand of friendship, and from the distant
banks of the Nile, from the deserts of Arabia, and the remote
confines of Syria, the followers of Mahomet rallied again
around the same banner, and hastened once more to fight in defence
of <i>Islam</i>. Al-Ma-lek, Al-a-del, Abou-becr Mohammed, the
renowned brother of Saladin, surnamed <i>Saif-ed-din</i>, “Sword of
the Faith,” took the command of the Moslem force, and speedily
proved himself a worthy successor to the great “Conqueror of
Jerusalem.” He concentrated a vast army, and by his rapid
movements speedily compelled the Germans to quit all the open
country, and throw themselves into the fortified city of Jaffa.
By a well-executed manœuvre, he then induced them to make a
rash sortie from the town, and falling suddenly upon the main
body of their forces, he defeated them with terrific slaughter.
He entered the city, pell-mell, with the fugitives, and annihilated
the entire German force. The small garrison of the Templars
maintained in the Temple of Jaffa was massacred, the fortifications
were razed to the ground, and the city was left without a
single christian inhabitant.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Such were the first results of this
memorable crusade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>The Templars on the receipt of this disastrous intelligence,
assembled their forces, and marched out of the city of Acre, in
the cool of the evening, to encamp at Caiphas, four miles distant
from the town. The king placed himself at the castle window
to see them pass, and was leaning forward watching their
progress across the neighbouring plain, when he unfortunately
overbalanced himself, and fell headlong into the moat. He
was killed on the spot, and queen Isabella was a second time
a widow, her divorced husband, Humphry de Thoron being,
however, still alive. She had three daughters by king Henry,
Mary, who died young, Alix, and Philippine. Radolph of Tiberias
became an aspirant for the hand of the widowed queen, but
the Templars rejected his suit because he was too poor, declaring
that they would not give the queen and the kingdom to a man
who had nothing. They sent the chancellor of the emperor of
Germany, who was staying at Acre, to Amauri, king of Cyprus,
offering him the hand of Isabella and the crown of the Latin
kingdom. Amauri had succeeded to the sovereignty of the
island on the death of his brother Guy de Lusignan, (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1194,)
and he eagerly embraced the offer. He immediately embarked
in his galleys at Nicosia, landed at Acre, and was married to
queen Isabella and solemnly crowned a few weeks after the death
of the late king.</p>

<p>On the arrival of a second division of the crusaders, under
the command of the dukes of Saxony and Brabant, the Templars
again took the field and overthrew the Arab cavalry in a bloody battle,
fought in the plain between Tyre and Sidon. The entire Mussulman
army was defeated, and Saif-ed-din, desperately wounded,
fell back upon Damascus. Beirout was then besieged and taken,
and the fall of this important city was followed by the reduction
of Gabala and Laodicea, and all the maritime towns between Tripoli
and Jaffa.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Intelligence now reached Palestine of the death
of the emperor Henry VI., whereupon all the German chieftains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
hurried home, to pursue upon another theatre their own schemes
of private ambition. After having provoked a terrific and sanguinary
war they retired from the contest, leaving their brethren
in the East to fight it out as they best could. These last, on
viewing their desolated lands, their defenceless cities, and their
dwellings destroyed by fire, exclaimed with bitterness and truth,
“Our fellow Christians and self-styled allies found us at <i>peace</i>,
they have left us at <span class="small">WAR</span>. They are like those ominous birds of
passage whose appearance portends the coming tempest.” To
add to the difficulties and misfortunes of the Latin Christians, a
quarrel sprung up between the Templars and Hospitallers touching
their respective rights to certain property in Palestine. The
matter was referred to the pope, who gravely admonished them,
representing that the infidels would not fail to take advantage of
their dissensions, to the great injury of the Holy Land, and to
the prejudice of all Christendom. He exhorts them to maintain
unity and peace with one another, and appoints certain arbitrators
to decide the differences between them. The quarrel
was of no great importance, nor of any long duration, for the
same year pope Innocent wrote to both orders, praising them
for their exertions in the cause of the cross, and exhorting them
strenuously and faithfully to support with all their might the
new king of Jerusalem.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>In the year 1201 the Grand Master of the Temple, Gilbert
Horal, was succeeded by brother Philip Duplessies, or De
Plesseis,<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> who found himself, shortly after his accession to
power, engaged in active hostilities with Leon I., king of Armenia,
who had taken possession of the castle of Gaston, which
belonged to the Knights Templars. The Templars drove King
Leon out of Antioch, compelled him to give up the castle of
Gaston and sue for peace. A suspension of arms was agreed
upon; the matters in dispute between them were referred to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
pope, and were eventually decided in favour of the Templars.
The Templars appear at this period to have recovered possession
of most of their castles and strongholds in the principalities of
Tripoli and Antioch. Taking advantage of the dissensions between
the neighbouring Moslem chieftains, they gradually drove
the infidels across the Orontes, and restored the strong mountain
districts to the christian arms. Some European vessels
having been plundered by Egyptian pirates, the Templars unfolded
their war-banner, and at midnight they marched out of
Acre, with the king of Jerusalem, to make reprisals on the Moslems;
they extended their ravages to the banks of the Jordan,
and collected together a vast booty, informing their brethren in
Acre of their movements by letters tied to the necks of pigeons.
Coradin, sultan of Damascus, assembled a large body of forces
at Sepphoris, and then marched against the hill fort Doc, which
belonged to the Templars. The place was only three miles distant
from Acre, and the population of the town was thrown into
the utmost consternation. But the military friars, assembling
their forces from all quarters, soon repulsed the invaders, and
restored tranquillity to the Latin kingdom.</p>

<p>At this period king Amauri, having partaken somewhat too
plentifully of a favourite dish of fish, was seized with an alarming
illness, and died at Acre on the 1st of April, <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1205. He
had issue by Isabella one daughter; but before the close of the
year both the mother and the child died. The crowns of Jerusalem
and Cyprus, which were united on the heads of Amauri and
Isabella, were now after their decease again divided. Mary, the
eldest daughter of the queen, by the famous Conrad, marquis of
Montferrat, was acknowledged heiress to the crown of the Latin
kingdom, and Hugh de Lusignan, the eldest son of Amauri by
his first wife, succeeded to the sovereignty of the island of Cyprus.
This young prince married the princess Alice, daughter
of Isabella by king Henry, count of Champagne, and half sister
to the young queen Mary by the mother’s side. The young and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
tender princess who had just now succeeded to the throne of the
Latin kingdom, was fourteen years of age, and the Templars
and Hospitallers became her natural guardians and protectors.
They directed the military force of the Latin empire in the field,
and the government of the country in the cabinet: and defended
the kingdom during her minority with zeal and success against
all the attacks of the infidels. As soon as the young queen arrived
at marriageable years, the Templars and Hospitallers sent
over the bishop of Acre and Aimar, lord of Cæsarea, to Philip
Augustus, king of France, requesting that monarch to select a
suitable husband for her from among his princes and nobles.
The king’s choice fell upon the count of Brienne, who left
France with a large cortége of knights and foot soldiers, and
arrived in Palestine on the 13th of September. The day after
his arrival he was married to the young queen, who had just
then attained her seventeenth year, and on the succeeding
Michaelmas-day, he was crowned king of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>At this period the truce with the infidels had expired, the
Grand Master of the Temple having previously refused to renew it.
Hostilities consequently recommenced, and the Templars again
took the field with the new king of Jerusalem and his French
knights. Some important successes were gained over the Moslems,
but the Latin kingdom was thrown into mourning by the
untimely death of the young queen Mary. She died at Acre, in
the twentieth year of her age, leaving by the king her husband,
an infant daughter, named Violante. The count de Brienne
continued, after the example of Guy de Lusignan, to wear the
crown, and exercise all the functions of royalty, notwithstanding
the death of the queen. Pope Innocent III. had long been endeavouring
to throw an additional lustre around his pontificate
by achieving the re-conquest of Jerusalem. By his bulls and apostolical
letters he sought to awaken the ancient enthusiasm of
Christendom in favour of the holy war; and following the example
of pope Urban, he at last called together a general council<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
of the church to aid in the arming of Europe for the recovery of
the Holy City. This council assembled at Rome in the summer
of the year 1215, and decreed the immediate preaching of
another crusade. The emperor Frederick, John, king of
England, the king of Hungary, the dukes of Austria and
Bavaria, and many prelates, nobles, and knights, besides crowds
of persons of inferior degree, assumed the cross. Some prepared
to fulfil their vow, and embark for the far East, but the far
greater portion of them paid sums of money to the clergy to be
exempt from the painful privations, dangers, and difficulties consequent
upon the long voyage. The king of Hungary, and the
dukes of Austria and Bavaria, were the first to set out upon the
pious enterprise. They placed themselves at the head of an
army composed of many different nations, embarked from Venice,
and landed at the port of St. Jean d’Acre at the commencement
of the year 1217. The day after the feast of All Saints they
marched out of Acre, and pitched their tents upon the banks of
the brook Kishon; and the next day the patriarch of Jerusalem,
and the Templars and Hospitallers, came with great pomp and
solemnity into the camp, bearing with them “a piece of the
true cross!” It was pretended that this piece of the cross had
been cut off before the battle of Tiberias, and carefully preserved
by the oriental clergy. The kings and princes went out bare-foot
and uncovered to receive the holy relic; they placed it at
the head of their array, and immediately commenced a bold and
spirited march to the Jordan.</p>

<p>Under the guidance of the Templars they followed the course
of the brook Kishon, by the ruins of Endor, to the valley of
Jezreel, and traversing the pass through the mountains of Gilboa
to Bisan or Scythopolis, they descended into the valley of the
Jordan, and pitched their tents on the banks of that sacred
river. From Bisan they proceeded up the valley of the Jordan
to the lake of Tiberias, skirted its beautiful shores to Bethsaida,
passing in front of the strong citadel of Tiberias, and then pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>ceeded
across the country to Acre, without meeting an enemy
to oppose their progress. The Templars then pressed the
christian chieftains to undertake without further loss of time the
siege of the important fortress of Mount Thabor, and at the
commencement of the autumn the place was regularly invested,
but the height and steepness of the mountain rendered the
transportation of heavy battering machines and military engines
to the summit a tedious and laborious undertaking. The troops
suffered from the want of water, their patience was exhausted,
and the four kings and their followers, being anxious to
return home, speedily found excuses for the abandonment
of the siege. The customary scene of disorder and confusion
then ensued; a large body of Arab horsemen, which had
crossed the Jordan, infested the rear of the retiring crusaders.
The disordered pilgrims and foot soldiers were panic-stricken,
and fled to the hills; and the retreat would have been disastrous,
but for the gallant conduct of the Templars and Hospitallers,
who covered the rear and sustained the repeated charges
of the Arab cavalry. The two orders sustained immense loss in
men and horses, and returned in sorrow and disgust to their
quarters at Acre.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>The Grand Master Philip Duplessies had been unable to take
part in the expedition; he was confined to the Temple at Acre
by a dangerous illness, of which he died a few days after the
return of the Templars from Mount Thabor. Immediately after
his decease a general chapter of knights was assembled, and
Brother William de Chartres was elevated (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1217) to the
vacant dignity of Grand Master.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Shortly after his election he
was called upon to take the command of a large fleet fitted out
by the order of the Temple against the Egyptians. He set sail
from Acre in the month of May, cast anchor in the mouth of
the Nile, and proceeded, in conjunction with the crusaders, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
lay siege to the wealthy and populous city of Damietta. The
Templars pitched their tents in the plain on the left bank of
the Nile, opposite the town, and surrounded their position with
a ditch and a wall. They covered the river with their galleys,
and with floating rafts furnished with military engines, and
directed their first attacks against a castle in the midst of the
stream, called the castle of Taphnis.</p>

<p>Large towers were erected upon floating rafts to protect their
operations, but they were constantly destroyed by the terrible
Greek fire, which was blown out of long copper tubes, and could
be extinguished with nothing but vinegar and sand. At last a
number of flat-bottomed boats were lashed together, and a
tower, higher than the castle of the enemy, was erected upon
them. It was ninety feet in height, thirteen cubits in length,
and was divided into platforms or stages, filled with archers;
numerous loop-holes were pierced in the walls, and the ponderous
structure was thickly covered in every part with raw hides,
to preserve it from the liquid fire of the enemy. Upon the top
of the tower was a drawbridge, which could be raised and lowered
with chains, and on each platform were grappling irons, to be
made fast to the battlements and parapets of the castle. On the
24th of August, the vast floating tower was towed to the point
of attack, and the left bank of the Nile was covered with a long
procession of priests and monks, who traversed the winding
shore, with naked feet and uplifted hands, praying to the God
of battles for victory. Whilst the infidels were hurrying to the
summit of the castle of Taphnis, to direct the Greek fire upon
the wooden tower, and to pour boiling oil and red-hot sand upon
the heads of the assailants, some Templars, who were stationed
in the lowest platform of the structure near the water, threw out
their grapling-irons, and made a lodgment upon the causeway in
front of the castle. Without a moment’s delay, they handed out
a battering-ram, and with one blow knocked in the door of the
fortress. Combustibles were immediately thrown into the in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>terior
of the building, the place was enveloped in smoke and
flames, and the garrison surrendered at discretion. The vast
chain between the castle and the river was then rent asunder,
and the large ships of the crusaders ascended the Nile, and took
up a position in front of the town.</p>

<p>Toward the close of autumn, when the inundation of the
Nile was at its height, a strong north wind arose, and impeded
the descent of the waters to the Mediterranean. The christian
camp was overflowed, the Templars lost all their provisions,
arms, and baggage; and when the waters receded, several large
fish were found in their tents. This catastrophe was followed
by an epidemic fever, which carried off the Grand Master, William
de Chartres, and many of the brethren. The Grand Master
was succeeded (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1218) by the veteran warrior, Brother Peter
de Montaigu, Grand Preceptor of Spain. At this period the
renowned Saif-ed-din, “sword of the faith,” the brother and
successor of Saladin, died, having appointed his <i>fifteen</i> sons to
separate and independent commands in his vast dominions.
After his decease they quarrelled with one another for the supremacy,
and the Templars crossed the Nile to take advantage of
the dispute. The infidels fiercely opposed their landing, and
one of the Temple vessels being boarded by an overpowering
force, the military friars cut a hole in the bottom of it with their
hatchets, and all on board met with a watery grave in the deep
bosom of the Nile. When the landing was effected, the Templars
were the first to charge the enemy; the Moslems fled and
abandoned their tents, provisions, and arms, and their camp
was given up to plunder. A trench was then drawn around the
city of Damietta, and the army took up a position which enabled
them to deprive the town of all succour. Two bridges of boats
were thrown across the Nile to communicate between the new
camp of the crusaders and the one they had just quitted; and
one of these bridges was placed under the protection of the
Templars. After many brilliant exploits and sanguinary en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>counters,
Damietta was reduced to great straits; terms of surrender
were offered and refused; and on the 5th of November a
wooden bridge was thrown over the ditch; scaling ladders were
reared against the battlements, and the town was taken by
assault. When the Templars entered the place, they found the
plague in every house, and the streets strewed with the dead.</p>

<p>Immediately after the capture of Damietta, the Grand Master
of the Temple returned with the king of Jerusalem to Palestine,
to oppose a fresh army of Moslems who, under the command of
Coradin, a famous chieftain, had invaded the country, blockaded
the city of Acre, and laid siege to the Pilgrim’s Castle. In
their intrenched camp at this castle, the Templars mustered a
force of upwards of four thousand men, who valiantly and successfully
defended the important position against the obstinate
and persevering attacks of the infidels. During the different
assaults upon the place, Coradin lost six emirs, two hundred
Mamlooks, and a number of archers; and on one day alone he
had a hundred and twenty valuable horses slain, one of which
cost fourteen thousand marks.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> The Templars sent urgent
letters to the pope for succour. They exhorted his holiness to
compel the emperor Frederick to perform his vow, and no longer
to permit the crusaders to compound with money for the non-fulfilment
of their engagements, declaring that such compositions
had been most injurious to the cause of the cross. The
Grand Master also wrote to the pope, complaining to his holiness
of the misapplication by the clergy of the money collected
from their flocks, towards the expenses of the holy war, declaring
that not a twentieth part of it ever reached the empty treasury of
the Latin kingdom. The holy pontiff, in his reply, protests
that he has not himself fingered a farthing of the money. “If
you have not received it,” says he, “it is not our fault, it is because
we have not been obeyed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>In a mournful letter to the bishop of Ely, the Grand Master
gives the following gloomy picture of the state of affairs.
“Brother Peter de Montaigu, Master of the Knights of the
Temple, to the reverend brother in Christ, N, by the grace of
God, bishop of Ely, salvation. We proceed by these our letters
to inform your paternity how we have managed the affairs of
our Lord Jesus Christ since the capture of Damietta and the
castle of Taphnis. Be it known to you, that during the spring
passage to Europe, immediately subsequent to the capture of
Damietta, so many of the pilgrims returned home, that the residue
of them scarce sufficed to garrison the town, and the two
intrenched camps. Our lord the legate, and the clergy, earnestly
desiring the advancement of the army of Jesus Christ, constantly
and diligently exhorted our people forthwith to take the field
against the infidels; but the chieftains from these parts, and from
beyond the sea, perceiving that the army was totally insufficient
in point of numbers to guard the city and the camps, and undertake
further offensive operations for the advancement of the
faith of Jesus Christ, would on no account give their consent.
The sultan of Egypt, at the head of a vast number of the
perfidious infidels, lies encamped a short distance from Damietta,
and he has recently constructed bridges across both branches of
the Nile, to impede the further progress of our christian soldiers.
He there remains, quietly awaiting their approach; and
the forces under his command are so numerous, that the faithful
cannot quit their intrenchments around Damietta, without incurring
imminent risk. In the mean time, we have surrounded
the town, and the two camps, with deep trenches, and have
strongly fortified both banks of the river as far as the sea-coast,
expecting that the Lord will console and comfort us with speedy
succour. But the Saracens, perceiving our weakness, have
already armed numerous galleys, and have inflicted vast injury
upon us by intercepting all the succours from Europe; and such
has been our extreme want of money, that we have been unable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
for a considerable period to man and equip our galleys and send
them to sea for our protection. Finding, however, that the
losses go on increasing to the great detriment of the cause of
the cross, we have now managed to arm some galleys, galliots,
and other craft, to oppose the ships of the infidels.</p>

<p>“Also be it known to you that Coradin, sultan of Damascus,
having collected together a vast army of Saracens, hath attacked
the cities of Tyre and Acre; and as the garrisons of these places
have been weakened to strengthen our forces in Egypt, they
can with difficulty sustain themselves against his attacks.
Coradin hath also pitched his tents before our fortress, called
the Pilgrim’s Castle, and hath put us to immense expense in
the defence of the place. He hath also besieged and subjugated
the castle of Cæsarea of Palestine. We have now for a long
time been expecting the arrival of the emperor, and the other
noble personages who have assumed the cross, by whose aid we
hope to be relieved from our dangers and difficulties, and to bring
all our exertions to a happy issue. But if we are disappointed
of the succour we expect in the ensuing summer (which God
forbid) all our newly-acquired conquests, as well as the places
that we have held for ages past, will be left in a very doubtful
condition. We ourselves, and others in these parts, are so impoverished
by the heavy expenses we have incurred in prosecuting
the affairs of Jesus Christ, that we shall be unable to contribute
the necessary funds, unless we speedily receive succour and
subsidies from the faithful. Given at Acre, xii. kal. Octob., <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span>
1220.”<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>The urgent solicitations of the Templars for money created
loud murmurs in England, and excited the wrath of the great
historian, Matthew Paris, the monk of St. Albans, who hated the
order on account of its vast privileges, and the sums it constantly
drew away from the hands of other religious bodies. The clergy,
who had probably misapplied the money collected by them for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
the relief of the Holy Land, joined eagerly in an outcry against
the Templars, accusing them of squandering their funds upon
magnificent churches and expensive buildings in Europe, or of
spending them at home in luxurious ease at their different
preceptories, instead of faithfully employing them in the prosecution
of the holy war. The pope instituted an inquiry
into the truth of the charges, and wrote to his legate at Damietta,
to the patriarch of Jerusalem, and the principal chieftains of the
army of the crusaders, for information. In their reply, the legate
and the patriarch state that the charges were untrue, and that the
Templars had expended their money in the prosecution of the siege
of Damietta, and had impoverished themselves by their heavy
expenses in Egypt. During the summer of the year 1221, considerable
succours arrived in Palestine and Egypt from Europe;
the troops of the sultan of Damascus were repulsed and driven
beyond the frontier of the Latin kingdom, and the Grand Master
of the Temple returned to Damietta to superintend the military
operations in Egypt. Cardinal Pelagius, the papal legate,
though altogether ignorant of the art of war, had unfortunately
assumed the inconsistent character of commander-in-chief of the
army of the cross. Contrary to the advice of the Templars, he
urged the crusaders, during the autumnal season, when the
waters of the Nile were rising, to march out of Damietta to undertake
an expedition against Grand Cairo. The disastrous
results of that memorable campaign are narrated in the following
letter from Peter de Montaigu to the Master of the English
province of the order.</p>

<p>“Brother Peter de Montaigu, humble Master of the soldiers
of Christ, to our vicegerent and beloved brother in Christ, Alan
Marcell, Preceptor of England. Hitherto we have had favourable
information to communicate unto you touching our exertions
in the cause of Christ; now, alas! such have been the
reverses and disasters which our sins have brought upon us in
the land of Egypt, that we have nothing but ill news to an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>nounce.
After the capture of Damietta, our army remained for
some time in a state of inaction, which brought upon us frequent
complaints and reproaches from the eastern and the
western Christians. At length, after the feast of the holy apostles,
the legate of the holy pontiff, and all our soldiers of the
cross, put themselves in march by land and by the Nile, and
arrived in good order at the spot where the sultan was encamped,
at the head of an immense number of the enemies of the cross.
The river Taphneos, an arm of the great Nile, flowed between the
camp of the sultan and our forces, and being unable to ford this
river, we pitched our tents on its banks, and prepared bridges to
enable us to force the passage. In the mean time, the annual
inundation rapidly increased, and the sultan, passing his galleys
and armed boats through an ancient canal, floated them into the
Nile below our positions, and intercepted our communications
with Damietta.”... “Nothing now was to be done but to
retrace our steps. The sultans of Aleppo, Damascus, Hems,
and Coilanbar, the two brothers of the sultan, and many chieftains
and kings of the pagans, with an immense multitude of
infidels who had come to their assistance, attempted to cut off
our retreat. At night we commenced our march, but the infidels
cut through the embankments of the Nile, the water rushed
along several unknown passages and ancient canals, and encompassed
us on all sides. We lost all our provisions, many of our
men were swept into the stream, and the further progress of
our christian warriors was forthwith arrested. The waters continued
to increase upon us, and in this terrible inundation we
lost all our horses and saddles, our carriages, baggage, furniture,
and moveables, and everything that we had. We ourselves
could neither advance nor retreat, and knew not whither to turn.
We could not attack the Egyptians on account of the great lake
which extended itself between them and us; we were without
food, and being caught and pent up like fish in a net, there was
nothing left for us but to treat with the sultan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>“We agreed to surrender Damietta, with all the prisoners
which we had in Tyre and at Acre, on condition that the sultan
restored to us the wood of the true cross and the prisoners that
he detained at Cairo and Damascus. We, with some others,
were deputed by the whole army to announce to the people of
Damietta the terms that had been imposed upon us. These
were very displeasing to the bishop of Acre, (James de Vitry,
the historian,) to the chancellor, and some others, who wished
to defend the town, a measure which we should indeed have
greatly approved of, had there been any reasonable chance of
success; for we would rather have been thrust into perpetual
imprisonment than have surrendered, to the shame of Christendom,
this conquest to the infidels. But after having made a
strict investigation into the means of defence, and finding
neither men nor money wherewith to protect the place, we were
obliged to submit to the conditions of the sultan, who, after
having extracted from us an oath and hostages, accorded to us
a truce of eight years. During the negotiations the sultan
faithfully kept his word, and for the space of fifteen days furnished
our soldiers with the bread and corn necessary for their
subsistence. Do you, therefore, pitying our misfortunes, hasten
to relieve them to the utmost of your ability. Farewell.”<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>Shortly after the disasters in Egypt, and the conclusion of the
eight years’ truce with the infidels, John de Brienne, the titular
king of Jerusalem, prepared to bid adieu for ever to Palestine.
Since the death of the young queen, his wife, he had regarded
his kingdom as a place of exile, and was anxious to escape from
the toil and turmoil and incessant warfare in which his feeble
dominions were continually involved. His daughter Violante,
the young queen of Jerusalem, had just attained her thirteenth
year, and the king was anxious to seek a suitable husband for
her from among the European princes. Accompanied by the
fair Violante, he landed in Italy, and attended a council of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
clergy and the laity assembled at Ferentino, in the Campagna di
Roma, in the summer of the year 1223. Pope Honorius the
Third, the emperor Frederick, the patriarch of the Holy City,
the bishop of Bethlehem, the Grand Master of the Hospital,
and one of the Grand Preceptors of the Temple, were present
at this council, and the pope urged the emperor to fulfil the
vow which he had made eight years before to lead an army to
the succour of the Holy Land; offering him the hand of the
lovely Violante, and with her the crown of the Latin kingdom.
This offer was accepted, the nuptials were shortly afterwards
celebrated, and the emperor solemnly took his oath upon the
Holy Gospel to lead in person a great expedition for the recovery
of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Violante had been accompanied from Palestine by a female
cousin, possessed of powerful charms and many graceful accomplishments.
The emperor became captivated with her beauty,
he dishonoured her, and treated his young wife, who was a mere
child in years, with coldness and neglect. He then, in the
middle of August, <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1227, set sail for Acre with a powerful
army, and was at sea three days, when he became sea-sick, and
returned to land on a plea of ill health. He was consequently
publicly excommunicated by the pope in the great church of
Anagni. Without troubling himself to obtain a reconciliation
with the holy see, he again embarked with his forces, and
arrived in the port of St. Jean d’Acre on the 8th of September,
<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1228. The pope then sent letters to Palestine denouncing him
as publicly excommunicated, and commanded the Templars not
to join his standard. They accordingly refused to take the field,
and as the forces under the command of the emperor did not
amount to ten thousand men, he was obliged to remain inactive
during the winter. He, however, carried on friendly negotiations
with the infidels, and a treaty was entered into whereby
Jerusalem was nominally surrendered to him. It was stipulated
that the Christian and Mussulman religion should meet with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
equal toleration in the Holy City; that the followers of Mahomet
should possess the Mosque of Omar, and the Christians the
great church of the Resurrection; that the Moslems should be
governed by their own laws, and that the court of judicature in
the forum of Al Rostak should be under the direction of a
Moslem governor.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>Immediately after the conclusion of this curious treaty, the
emperor made a peaceful march to the Holy City with a few
attendants, and performed the solemn farce of crowning himself
in the church of the Resurrection. After a stay of a few days
in Jerusalem, he hurried back to Acre to prepare for his departure
for Europe. No christian garrison was established in the
city, nor did the Templars and Hospitallers venture to return
to their ancient abodes. His conduct, immediately preceding
his departure, is thus described in a letter from the patriarch of
Jerusalem to the pope. “The emperor placed archers at the
gates of the city of Acre, to prevent the Templars from entering
into or proceeding out of the town. He moreover placed soldiers
in all the streets leading to our quarter and the Temple,
keeping us in a state of siege; and it is evident that he has
never treated the Saracens half so badly as he has treated the
Christians. For a long time he refused to permit any provisions
to be brought to us, and instructed his soldiers to insult the
priests and the Templars whenever they met them. He moreover
got possession of the magazines, and removed all the military
machines and arms, preserved for the defence of the city,
with a view of rendering good service to his kind friend the sultan
of Egypt; and afterwards, without saying adieu to anybody, he
embarked secretly on the 1st of May, (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1229,) leaving us
worse off than he found us.”<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>The Grand Master of the Temple, Peter de Montaigu, died
at Acre at an advanced age, and was succeeded (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1233) by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
Brother Hermann de Perigord, Grand Preceptor of Calabria and
Sicily.<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> Shortly after his accession to power, the truce with the
sultan of Aleppo expired, and Brother William de Montferrat,
Preceptor of Antioch, having besieged a fortress of the infidels,
refused to retreat before a superior force, and was surrounded
and overwhelmed; a hundred knights of the Temple, and three
hundred cross-bowmen were slain, together with many secular
warriors, and a large number of foot soldiers. The <i>Balcanifer</i>,
or standard-bearer, on this occasion, was an English Knight
Templar, named Reginald d’Argenton, who performed prodigies
of valour. He was disabled and covered with wounds, yet he
unflinchingly bore the Beauseant aloft with his bleeding arms
into the thickest of the fight, until he at last fell dead upon a
heap of his slaughtered comrades. The Preceptor of Antioch,
before he was slain, “sent sixteen infidels to hell.” As soon
as the Templars in England heard of this disaster, they sent,
(<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1236,) in conjunction with the Hospitallers, instant succour
to their brethren. “Having made their arrangements,” says
Matthew Paris, “they started from the house of the Hospitallers
at Clerkenwell in London, and passed through the city with
spears held aloft, shields displayed, and banners advanced.
They marched in splendid pomp to the bridge, and sought a
blessing from all who crowded to see them pass. The brothers
indeed, uncovered, bowed their heads from side to side, and
recommended themselves to the prayers of all.”</p>

<p>A new crusade had already been preached in Europe by Pope
Gregory IX., and the Templars, expecting the arrival of speedy
succour, and being desirous of taking advantage of the dissensions
that had arisen amongst the Saracens, had recommenced
hostilities with the sultans of Egypt and Damascus. Thibaut I.,
king of Navarre, and count of Champagne, the duke of Burgundy,
and the counts of Brittany and Bar, who had arrived in
Palestine with several other nobles and knights, and a consider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>able
force of armed pilgrims, marched with a party of Templars
to attack the sultan of Egypt, whilst the Grand Master
prepared to invade the territory of the sultan of Damascus. In
a bloody battle fought with the Mamlooks, near Gaza, the count
de Bar and many knights and persons of quality, and all the
foot soldiers, were slain; the count de Montfort was taken prisoner,
and all the equipage and baggage of the army was lost.
The king of Navarre and the survivors then retreated to Jaffa,
and set sail from that port for St. Jean d’Acre. On their arrival
at this place, they joined the Grand Master of the Temple, who
was encamped at the palm-grove of Caiphas. Thence they
marched towards Tiberias, and on their arrival at Sepphoris,
they met some messengers who were proceeding from Saleh
Ismael, the sultan of Damascus, to the Grand Master of the
Temple, with overtures of peace, and offers to surrender Jerusalem
upon the following terms:&mdash;The Moslem and christian
prisoners of war were immediately to be set at liberty; all
Palestine, between the sea-coast and the Jordan, excepting the
cities of St. Abraham, Naplous, and Bisan, was to be surrendered
to the Christians; the Christians were to assist the sultan of
Damascus in a war which had broken out between him and
Nojmoddin Ayoub sultan of Egypt; they were to march with all
their forces to the south to occupy Jaffa and Ascalon, and prevent
the latter potentate from marching through Palestine to
attack the sultan of Damascus; and lastly, no truce was to be
entered into with the sultan of Egypt by the Christians, unless
the sultan of Damascus was included therein. The Grand
Master of the Temple acceded to these terms, and induced the
chiefs of the crusaders to assent to the compact; but the Grand
Master of the Hospital refused to be a party to it. It is said
that he entered into a separate and independent treaty with
Nojmoddin Ayoub, who had just mounted the throne of Egypt,
so that one of the great military orders remained at war with
the sultan of Damascus, and the other with the sultan of Egypt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
Immediately after the conclusion of this treaty, the Templars
assembled all their disposable forces and proceeded to Jaffa
with the count de Nevers, and a body of newly arrived crusaders,
and co-operated with an army which the sultan of Damascus
had sent into that neighbourhood to act against the Egyptians.
In the mean time, Richard, earl of Cornwall, the brother of
Henry III., king of England, having assumed the cross, arrived
in Palestine, and proceeded with a small force of English pilgrims,
knights, and foot soldiers, to the camp of the Templars
at Jaffa. With this welcome reinforcement the Grand Master
of the Temple marched at once upon Ascalon, re-constructed
the castle and restored the fortifications to the state in which
they were left by Richard Cœur de Lion. The Templars then
endeavoured to obtain possession of their ancient fortress of
Gaza, (ante, <a href="#Page_49">p. 49</a>,) a place of very great importance. An invading
army from the south could approach Jerusalem only by
way of Gaza, or by taking a long and tedious route through the
desert of Arabia Petræa, to Karac, and from thence to Hebron,
by the southern extremity of the Dead Sea. The want of water
and forage presented an insuperable obstacle to the march of a
large body of forces in any other direction. Towards the close
of autumn, the Templars marched against Gaza in conjunction
with Saleh Ismael, sultan of Damascus; they drove out the
Egyptians, and obtained possession of the dismantled fortifications.
Large sums of money were expended in the re-construction
of the walls of the castle, a strong garrison was established
in the important post, and the Templars then marched upon
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The fortifications of the Holy City had been dismantled by
Malek Kamel, at the period of the siege of Damietta, when
alarmed at the military success of the Franks in Egypt, he was
anxious to purchase the safety of the country by the cession of
Jerusalem. The Templars, consequently, entered the Holy
City without difficulty or resistance; the Mussulman population<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
abandoned their dwellings on their approach, and the military
friars once more entered the city of David, bare-footed and bare-headed,
singing loud hymns and songs of triumph. They
rushed to the church of the Resurrection, and fell prostrate on
their knees before the shrine of the Holy Sepulchre; they
ascended Mount Calvary, and visited the reputed scene of the
crucifixion, and then hastened in martial array, and with sound
of trumpet, through the forlorn and deserted streets of the city
of Zion, to take possession of their ancient quarters on Mount
Moriah.</p>

<p>The golden crescent was once more removed from the lofty
pinnacle of the Temple of the Lord, or Mosque of Omar, and
this Holy Mussulman house of prayer was once again surmounted
by the glittering cross. The Temple of the Knights
Templars or Mosque at Acsa, (ante, <a href="#Page_12">p. 12</a>,) was again purified
and re-consecrated, and its sombre halls and spacious
areas were once more graced with the white, religious, and military
habit of the knights of the Temple. The greater part of
the old convent, adjoining the Temple, had been destroyed, as
before mentioned, by the great Saladin, and the military friars
were consequently obliged to pitch numerous tents in the
spacious area for the accommodation of the brethren. The
sound of the bell once more superseded the voice of the muezzin,
“the exiled faith returned to its ancient sanctuary,” and the
name of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> was again invoked in the high places and sanctuaries
of <i>Mahomet</i>. The great court of the Mussulmen around
the revered Mosque of Omar, called by them <i>El Scham Schereef</i>,
“the noble retirement,” again rung with the tramp of the war-steed,
and its solitudes were once more awakened with the voice
of the trumpet.</p>

<p>Nothing could exceed the joy with which the intelligence of
the re-occupation of Jerusalem was received throughout Palestine,
and through all Christendom. The Hospitallers, now that
the policy of the Templars had been crowned with success, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
that Jerusalem had been regained, no longer opposed the treaty
with the sultan of Damascus, but hastened to co-operate with
them for the preservation of the Holy City, which had been so
happily recovered. The patriarch returned to Jerusalem, (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span>
1241,) with all his clergy; the churches were re-consecrated,
and the Templars and Hospitallers emptied their treasuries in
rebuilding the walls. The following account of these gratifying
events was transmitted by brother Hermann de Perigord to the
Master of the Temple at London. “Brother Hermann de
Perigord, humble minister of the poor knights of the Temple,
to his beloved brother in Christ Robert de Sandford, Preceptor
in England, salvation through the Lord.</p>

<p>“Since it is our duty, whenever an opportunity offers, to
make known to the brotherhood, by letters or by messengers,
the state and prospects of the Holy Land, we hasten to inform
you, that after our great successes against the sultan of Egypt,
and Nasser, his supporter and abettor, the great persecutor of
the Christians, whom we have unceasingly endeavoured with all
our might to subdue, they were unwillingly compelled to treat
with us concerning the establishment of a truce, promising us
to restore to the followers of Jesus Christ all the territory on
this side Jordan. We despatched certain of our brethren,
noble and discreet personages, to Cairo, to have an interview
with the sultan upon these matters. But the latter broke the
promise which he had made to us, retaining in his own hands
Gaza, St. Abraham, Naplous, Varan, and other places; he detained
our messengers in custody for more than half a year, and
endeavoured to amuse us with deceitful words and unmeaning
propositions. But we, with the Divine assistance, were enabled
to penetrate his craft and perfidy, and plainly saw that he had
procured the truce with us that he might be enabled the more
readily to subjugate to his cruel dominion the sultan of Damascus,
and Nasser lord of Carac, and their territories; and
then, when he had got possession of all the country surround<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>ing
our christian provinces, we plainly foresaw that he would
break faith with us, after the custom of his unbelieving generation,
and attack our poor Christianity on this side the sea,
which in its present weak and feeble state would have been
unable effectually to resist him.</p>

<p>“Having therefore deliberated, long and earnestly, upon
these matters, we determined, with the advice of the bishops
and some of the barons of the land, to break off at once with
the sultan of Egypt, and enter into a treaty with the sultan of
Damascus, and with Nasser lord of Carac, whereby all the
country on this side Jordan, excepting St. Abraham, Naplous,
and Bisan, has been surrendered to the christian worship; and,
to the joy of angels and of men, the holy city of Jerusalem is
now inhabited by Christians alone, all the Saracens being
driven out. The holy places have been re-consecrated and purified
by the prelates of the churches, and in those spots where
the name of the Lord has not been invoked for fifty-six years,
now, blessed be God, the divine mysteries are daily celebrated.
To all the sacred places there is again free access to the faithful
in Christ, nor is it to be doubted but that in this happy and
prosperous condition we might long remain, if our Eastern
Christians would from henceforth live in greater concord and
unanimity. But, alas! opposition and contradiction, arising
from envy and hatred, have impeded our efforts in the promotion
of these and other advantages for the Holy Land. With
the exception of the prelates of the churches, and a few of the
barons, who afford us all the assistance in their power, the
entire burthen of its defence rests upon our house alone. With
the assistance of the sultan of Damascus, and the lord of Carac,
we have obtained possession of the city of Gaza, situate on the
confines of the territory of Jerusalem and the territory of Egypt.
And as this important place commands the entrance from the
latter country into the Holy Land, we have, by vast exertions,
and at an enormous expense, and after having incurred great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
risk and danger, put it into a state of defence. But we are
afraid that God will take heavy vengeance for past ingratitude,
by punishing those who have been careless, and indifferent, and
rebellious in the prosecution of these matters.</p>

<p>“For the safeguard and preservation of the holy territory, we
propose to erect a fortified castle near Jerusalem, which will
enable us the more easily to retain possession of the country,
and to protect it against all enemies. But indeed we can in
nowise defend for any great length of time the places that we
hold, against the powerful and crafty sultan of Egypt, unless
Christ and his faithful followers extend to us an efficacious
support.”<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>We must now refer to a few events connected with the English
province of the order of the Temple.</p>

<p>Brother Geoffrey, who was Master of the Temple at London,
at the period of the consecration of the Temple Church by
Heraclius, patriarch of Jerusalem, died shortly after the capture
of the Holy City by Saladin, and was succeeded by Brother
Amaric de St. Maur, who is an attesting witness to the deed
executed by king John, (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1203,) granting a dowry to his
young queen, the beautiful Isabella of Angouleme. King John
frequently resided in the Temple for weeks together, the writs
to his lieutenants, sheriffs, and bailiffs, being dated therefrom.
The orders for the concentration of the English fleet at Portsmouth,
to resist the formidable French invasion instigated by
the pope, are dated from the <span class="smcap">Temple</span> at London, and the convention
between the king and the count of Holland, whereby
the latter agreed to assist King John with a body of knights
and men-at-arms, in case of the landing of the French, was
published at the same place. In all the conferences and negotiations
between king John and the Roman pontiff, the Knights
Templars took an active and distinguished part. Two brethren<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
of the order were sent to him by Pandulph, the papal legate, to
arrange that famous conference between them which ended in
the complete submission of the king to all the demands of the
holy see. By the advice and persuasion of the Templars, John
repaired to the preceptory of Temple Ewell, near Dover, where
he was met by the legate Pandulph, who crossed over from
France to confer with him, and the mean-hearted king was
there frightened into that celebrated resignation of the kingdoms
of England and Ireland, “to God, to the holy apostles
Peter and Paul, to the holy Roman church his mother, and to
his lord, Pope Innocent the Third, and his catholic successors,
for the remission of all his sins and the sins of all his people
as well the living as the dead.” The following year, the commands
of king John for the extirpation of the heretics in Gascony,
addressed to the seneschal of that province, were issued
from the Temple at London, and about the same period, the
Templars were made the depositaries of various private and
confidential matters pending between king John and his illustrious
sister-in-law, “the royal, eloquent, and beauteous” Berengaria
of Navarre, the youthful widowed queen of Richard <i>Cœur
de Lion</i>. The Templars in England managed the money transactions
of that fair princess. She directed her dower to be
paid in the house of the New Temple at London, together with
the arrears due to her from the king, amounting to several
thousand pounds.</p>

<p>John was resident at the Temple when he was compelled by
the barons of England to sign <span class="smcap">Magna Charta</span>. Matthew Paris
tells us that the barons came to him whilst he was residing in
the New Temple at London, “in a very resolute manner,
clothed in their military dresses, and demanded the liberties and
laws of king Edward, with others for themselves, the kingdom,
and the church of England.”<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>Brother Amaric de St. Maur, the Master of the English province
of the order, was succeeded by brother Alan Marcell, the
friend and correspondent of the Grand Master Peter de Montaigu
(ante <a href="#Page_161">p. 161</a>). He was at the head of the order in England
for the space of sixteen years, and was employed by king Henry
the Third in various important negotiations. He was Master of
the Temple at London, when Reginald, king of the island of
Man, by the advice and persuasion of the legate Pandulph,
made a solemn surrender at that place of his island to the pope
and his catholic successors, and consented to hold the same from
thenceforth as the feudatory of the church of Rome. On the
28th of April, <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1224, the Master, Brother Alan Marcell, was
employed by king Henry to negotiate a truce between himself
and the king of France. The king of England appears at that
time to have been resident at the Temple, the letters of credence
being made out at that place, in the presence of the archbishop
of Canterbury, several bishops, and Hubert, the chief justiciary.
The year after, Alan Marcell was sent into Germany, to negotiate
a treaty of marriage between king Henry and the daughter
of the duke of Austria.<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> Brother Alan Marcell was succeeded
by Brother Amberaldus. The next Master of the English province
was Robert Mounford, and he was followed by Robert Sanford
(ante <a href="#Page_56">p. 56</a>).</p>

<p>During the Mastership of Robert Sanford, on Ascension Day,
<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1240, the oblong portion of the Temple Church, which extendeth
eastward from “<span class="small">THE ROUND</span>,” was consecrated in the presence
of king Henry the Third and all his court, and much of
the nobility of the kingdom. This portion of the sacred edifice
was of a lighter and more florid style of architecture than the
earlier Round Church consecrated by the patriarch Heraclius
(ante <a href="#Page_46">p. 46</a>). The walls were pierced with numerous triple lancet
windows filled with stained glass, and the floor was covered with
tesselated pavement. The roof was supported by dark grey Pur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>beck
marble columns, and the vaulted ceiling was decorated with
the star of Bethlehem, and with ornaments of frosted silver
placed on a blue ground. The extensive area of the church was
open and unencumbered by pews, and the beauty of the columns
and windows, the lively colours of the tiled floor, and the elegant
proportions of the fabric were seen at a glance. After the consecration,
the king made provision for the maintenance in the
Temple of three chaplains, who were to say three masses daily
for ever, one for the king himself, another for all christian
people, and the third for the faithful departed.<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p class="caption">INTERIOR OF THE TEMPLE CHURCH</p>
</div>

<p>King Henry III. was one of the greatest of the benefactors of
the order. He granted to the Templars the manors of Lilleston,
Hechewayton, and Saunford, the wood of Carletone, Kingswood
near Chippenhan, a messuage, and six bovates of land with their
appurtenances in Great Lymburgh; a fair at Walnesford, in the
county of Essex, every three years for three days, to commence
on the anniversary of the beheading of St. John the Baptist;
also annual fairs and weekly markets at Newburgh, Walnesford,
Balsall, Kirkeby, and a variety of other places; he granted them
free warren in all their demesne lands; and by his famous charter,
dated the 9th day of February, in the eleventh year of his
reign, he confirmed to them all the donations of his predecessors,
and of their other benefactors, and conferred upon them vast privileges
and immunities in the following pious and reverential
terms.</p>

<p>“The king, &amp;c., to all the archbishops, bishops, barons, &amp;c. &amp;c.,
to whom these presents shall come, salvation through the Lord.
Be it known to you that we have granted and confirmed to God
and the blessed Mary, and the brethren of the chivalry of the
Temple of Solomon, all reasonable donations of lands, men, and
eleemosynary gifts, bestowed on them by our predecessors, or by
others in times past, or by ourselves at this present period, or
which may be hereafter conferred on them by kings or by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
liberality of subjects, or may be acquired, or be about to be acquired
in any other manner, as well churches as worldly goods
and possessions; wherefore we will and firmly command that the
aforesaid brethren and their men may have and hold all their
possessions and eleemosynary donations with all liberties and
free customs and immunities, in wood and plain, in meadow and
pasture, in water and water-mills, on highways and byeways, in
ponds and running streams, in marshes and fisheries, in granges
and broad acres, within burgh and without the burgh, with soc
and sac, tol and theam, infangenethef and unfangenethef, and
hamsoc and grithbrich, and blodwit and fictwit, and flictwit and
ferdwite, and hengewite and lierwite, and flemenefrith, murder,
robbery, forstall, ordel, oreste, in season and out of season, at
all times and in all places, &amp;c.</p>

<p>“We ordain, likewise, that the aforesaid brethren shall for
ever hereafter be freed from royal aids, and sheriff’s aids, and
officer’s aids, and from hidage and carucage, and danegeld and
hornegeld, and from military and wapentake services, and scutages
and lastages and stallages, shires and hundreds, pleas and
quarrels, ward and wardpeny, and averpeni and hundredspeni,
and borethalpeni and thethingepeni, and from the works of castles,
parks, bridges, and inclosures; and from the duty of providing
carriages and beasts of burthen, boats, and vessels, and
from the building of royal houses, and all other works. And we
prohibit all persons from taking timber from their woods and
forests for such works, or for any other purposes whatever: neither
shall their corn, nor the corn of their men, nor any of their
goods, nor the goods of any belonging to them, be taken to fortify
castles. We will also that they shall have free and full
liberty to cut and fell timber whenever they please, in all their
woods, for the use of their fraternity, without any let or hindrance
whatever; and for doing so they shall not incur forfeiture
or waste, or in any way be punishable by law. And all their
lands, and the ground which they or their men have cleared of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
wood, and recovered from the forest, or which they may clear in
time to come, with the assent of the king, we make quit and free
for ever hereafter from waste regard, and view of foresters, and
from all other customs. And we concede also to the aforesaid
brethren the privilege of cutting down trees in all the woods
they possess at present within the forest boundaries, and of
clearing and bringing the land into cultivation without any
license from our bailiffs, so that they may never at any time
hereafter be in any way called to account by ourselves, or our
heirs, or any of our bailiffs.</p>

<p>“We ordain, moreover, that the aforesaid brethren and their
men shall be quit and free from every kind of toll in all markets
and fairs, and upon crossing bridges, roads, and ferries, throughout
the whole of our kingdom, and throughout all lands in
which we are able to grant liberties; and all their markets, and
the markets of their men, shall in like manner be quit and free
from all toll. We grant and confirm also to the aforesaid brethren,
that if any of their men be condemned to lose life or limb
for crime, or shall have fled from justice, or have committed any
offence for which he hath incurred forfeiture of his goods and
chattels, the goods and chattels so forfeited shall belong to the
aforesaid brethren, whether the cognizance of the offence belongeth
to our court or to any other inferior court; and it shall
be lawful for the aforesaid brethren, under such circumstances
and in such cases, to put themselves in possession of the aforesaid
goods and chattels at such time as our bailiffs would or
ought to have seized them into our hands, had such goods and
chattels belonged to ourselves, without the molestation or hindrance
of the sheriffs or bailiffs, or any other persons whatever.</p>

<p>“We concede also to the aforesaid brethren, that animals
called <i>waif</i>, lost by their owners, and found within the feud of
the Templars, shall belong to the aforesaid brethren, unless
they are followed by some one able and willing to prove that
they are his own, and unless they shall be sought after and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
taken possession of by the owner within a moderate period of
time, according to the custom of the country. And if any of the
tenants of the aforesaid brethren shall happen to have incurred
a forfeiture of his feud, it shall be lawful for the said brethren to
take possession of the said feud, and hold the same, notwithstanding
the law which concedes to ourselves the possession of
the feud of fugitives and criminals, for the space of a year and a
day. In like manner, if any of the men of the aforesaid brethren
shall have incurred a fine to be paid to ourselves or to any of our
bailiffs, under any process, or for any crime, or any other matter,
the amercements of money shall be collected and brought in a
purse to our exchequer, and there handed over to the aforesaid
brethren; judgment of death and limb being always reserved to
the royal authority.</p>

<p>“We moreover ordain, that if any of the liberties and privileges
contained in this our charter shall happen to have been
disused for a length of time, such disuse shall in no respect prejudice
the right, but such liberty or privilege may be again exercised
without contradiction, notwithstanding that it may have
been discontinued and disused as aforesaid. And all the aforesaid
things, and all other secular services and customs which are
not included in this present writing, we, through love of God,
and for the good of the soul of the lord king John, our father,
and for the good of the souls of all our predecessors and successors,
grant and confirm to them, as a perpetual alms-gift, with
all liberties and free customs, as fully, freely, and effectually as
the royal power can confer them upon any religious house. And
we prohibit all persons, on pain of forfeiture, from proceeding
against them or their men contrary to this our charter, for we have
taken the aforesaid brethren, and all their goods, and possessions,
and all their men, under our especial guardianship and
protection. As witness the king, at Westminster, the 9th day of

<p>By the royal grant of <i>soc</i> and <i>sac</i>, <i>tol</i> and <i>theam</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c., the
Templars were clothed with the power of holding courts to impose
and levy fines and amerciaments upon their tenants, to
judge and punish their villeins and vassals&mdash;to take cognizance
of quarrels and controversies that arose amongst them&mdash;to try
thieves and malefactors belonging to their manors, and all foreign
thieves taken within the precincts thereof&mdash;to try and punish
trespasses and breaches of the peace, and all unlawful entries
into the houses of their tenants&mdash;to impose and levy amerciaments
for cutting and maiming, and for bloodshed&mdash;to judge
and punish by fine or imprisonment the seducers of their bond
women, and all persons who committed adultery and fornication
within their manors. They had the power of trying criminals
by ordeal, or the terrible test of fire and water; and they had,
lastly, the tremendous privilege of pit or gallows, i. e. the power
of putting convicted thieves to death, by hanging them if they
were men, and drowning them if they were women! By the
royal charter, the Templars were, in the next place, freed from
the fine of right payable to the king for the hanging of thieves
without a formal trial and judgment according to law; they were
exempted from the taxes on pasture-lands, and plough-lands, and
horned cattle; from the Danish tribute, and from all military
services, and from all the ordinary feudal burthens.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>“The Knights of the <span class="smcap">Temple</span> ever maintained their fearless and fanatic character; if they

<p class="p2">Shortly after the recovery of the holy city, (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1242,) Djemal’eddeen,
the Mussulman, paid a visit to Jerusalem. “I saw,”
says he, “the monks and the priests masters of the Temple of
the Lord. I saw the vials of wine prepared for the sacrifice. I
entered into the Mosque Al Acsa, (the Temple of the Knights
Templars, ante, <a href="#Page_12">p. 12</a>,) and I saw a bell suspended from the
dome. The rites and ceremonies of the Mussulmen were abolished;
the call to prayer was no longer heard. The infidels publicly
exercised their idolatrous practices in the sanctuaries of the
Mussulmen.”<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> By the advice of Benedict, bishop of Marseilles,
who came to the holy city on a pilgrimage, the Templars rebuilt
their ancient and once formidable castle of Saphet, the dilapi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>dated
ruins of which had been ceded to them by their recent
treaty with Saleh Ismael. During a pilgrimage to the lake of
Tiberias and the banks of the Jordan, the bishop of Marseilles
had halted at Saphet, and spent a night amid the ruins of the
ancient castle, where he found a solitary Knight Templar keeping
watch in a miserable hovel. Struck with the position of the
place, and its importance in a military point of view, he sought
on his return to Acre an interview with the Grand Master of the
Temple, and urged him to restore the castle of Saphet to its
pristine condition. The bishop was invited to attend a general
chapter of the order of the Temple, when the matter was discussed,
and it was unanimously determined that the mountain
of Saphet should immediately be refortified. The bishop himself
laid the first stone, and animated the workmen by a spirited
oration. Eight hundred and fifty masons and artificers, and
four hundred slaves, were employed in the task. During the
first thirty months after the commencement of operations,
the Templars expended eleven thousand golden bezants upon
the works, and in succeeding years they spent upwards of forty
thousand. The walls, when finished, were sixty French feet in
width, one hundred and seventy in height, and the circuit of
them was two thousand two hundred and fifty feet. They were
flanked by seven large round towers, sixty feet in diameter, and
seventy-two feet higher than the walls. The fosse surrounding
the fortress was thirty-six feet wide, and was pierced in the solid
rock to a depth of forty-three feet. The garrison in time of
peace amounted to one thousand seven hundred men, and to two
thousand two hundred in time of war. Twelve thousand mule
loads of corn and barley were consumed annually within the
walls of the fortress; and in addition to all the ordinary expenses
and requirements of the establishment, the Templars
maintained a well-furnished table and excellent accommodation
for all way-worn pilgrims and travellers. “The generous expenditure
of the Templars at this place,” says a cotemporary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
historian, “renders them truly worthy of the liberality and largesses
of the faithful.”<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>The ruins of this famous castle, crowning the summit of a
lofty mountain, torn and shattered by earthquakes, still present
a stupendous appearance. In Pocock’s time “two particularly
fine large round towers” were entire: and Van Egmont and
Heyman give the following account of the condition of the fortress
at the period of their visit. “The next place that engaged
our attention was the citadel, which is the greatest object of
curiosity in Saphet, and is generally considered one of the most
ancient structures remaining in the country. In order to form
some idea of this fortification in its present state, imagine a lofty
mountain, and on its summit a round castle, with walls of incredible
thickness, and with a <i>corridor</i> or covered passage extending
round the walls, and ascended by a winding staircase. The
thickness of the walls and corridor together was twenty paces.
The whole was of hewn stone, and some of the stones are eight
or nine spans in length.... This castle was anciently surrounded
with stupendous works, as appears from the remains of
two moats lined with free-stone, several fragments of walls, bulwarks,
towers, &amp;c., all very solid and strongly built; and below
these moats other massive works, having corridors round them
in the same manner as the castle; so that any person, on surveying
these fortifications, may wonder how so strong a fortress
could ever be taken.” Amongst the various interesting remains
of this castle, these intelligent travellers describe “a large structure
of free-stone in the form of a cupola or dome. The stones,
which are almost white, are of astonishing magnitude, some
being twelve spans in length and five in thickness. The inside
is full of niches for placing statues, and near each niche is a
small cell. An open colonnade extends quite round the building,
and, like the rest of the structure, is very massive and compact.”<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>When the sultan of Egypt had been informed of the march of
the Templars to Jerusalem, and the re-possession by the military
friars of the holy places and sanctuaries of the Mussulmen,
he sent an army of several thousand men across the desert, to
drive them out of the Holy City before they had time to repair
the fortifications and re-construct the walls. The Templars assembled
all their forces and advanced to meet the Egyptians.
They occupied the passes and defiles of the hill country leading
to Jerusalem, and gained a glorious victory over the Moslems,
driving the greater part of them into the desert. Ayoub, sultan
of Egypt, finding himself unable to resist the formidable alliance
of the Templars with Saleh Ismael, called in to his assistance
the fierce pastoral tribes of the Carizmians. These were a warlike
race of people, who had been driven from their abodes, in
the neighbourhood of the Caspian, by the successful arms of the
Moguls, and had rushed headlong upon the weak and effeminate
nations of the south. They had devastated and laid waste
Armenia and the north-western parts of Persia, cutting off by
the sword, or dragging away into captivity, all who had ventured
to oppose their progress. For years past they had been leading
a migratory, wandering life, exhausting the resources of one district,
and then passing onwards into another, without making
any fixed settlement, or having any regular places of abode, and
their destructive progress has been compared by the Arabian
writers to the wasting tempest or the terrible inundation. The rude
hardships of their roving life had endowed them with a passive
endurance which enabled them to surmount all obstacles, and
to overcome every difficulty. Their clothing consisted of a solitary
sheep’s skin, or a wolf’s skin, tied around their loins;
boiled herbs and some water, or a little milk, sufficed them for
food and beverage; their arms were the bow and the lance; and
they shed the blood of their fellow-creatures with the same indifference
as they would that of the beasts of the field. Their
wives and their children accompanied their march, braving all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
dangers and fatigues; their tents were their homes, and the site
of their encampment their only country. Nothing could exceed
the terror inspired in Armenia and Persia by the military expeditions
of these rude and ferocious shepherds of the Caspian,
who were the foes of all races and of all people, and manifested
a profound indifference for every religion.</p>

<p>The Carizmians were encamped on the left bank of the Euphrates,
pasturing their cavalry in the neighbouring plains,
when their chief, Barbeh Khan, received a deputation from the
sultan of Egypt, inviting their co-operation and assistance in the
reduction of Palestine. Their cupidity was awakened by an
exaggerated account of the fertility and the wealth of the land,
and they were offered a settlement in the country as soon as it
was rescued from the hands of the Franks. The messengers
displayed the written letters of the sultan of Egypt; they presented
to the Carizmian chief some rich shawls and magnificent
presents, and returned to their master at Grand Cairo with promises
of speedy support. The Carizmians assembled together
in a body; they crossed the Euphrates (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1244) in small
leathern boats, ravaged the territories of the sultan of Aleppo,
and marched up the plain of the Orontes to Hems, wasting all
the country around them with fire and the sword. The intelligence
of these events reached the Grand Master of the Temple
when he was busily engaged in rebuilding the vast and extensive
fortifications of the Holy City. A council of war was called
together, and it was determined that Jerusalem was untenable,
and that the Holy City must once again be abandoned to the
infidels. The Hospitallers in their black mantles, and the
Templars in their white habits, were drawn up in martial array
in the streets of Jerusalem, and the weeping Christians were
exhorted once again to leave their homes and avail themselves
of the escort and protection of the military friars to Jaffa. Many
gathered together their little property and quitted the devoted
city, and many lingered behind amid the scenes they loved and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
cherished. Soon, however, frightful reports reached Jerusalem
of the horrors of the Carizmian invasion, and the fugitives, who
had fled with terror and astonishment from their destructive
progress, spread alarm and consternation throughout the whole
land. Several thousand Christians, who had remained behind,
then attempted to make their escape, with their wives and
children, through the mountains to the plain of Ramleh and the
sea-coast, relying on the truce and treaty of alliance which had
been established with Nasser Daoud, lord of Carac, and the
mountaineers. But the inhabitants of the mountain region,
being a set of lawless robbers and plunderers, attacked and pillaged
them. Some were slain, and others were dragged away
into captivity. A few fled back to Jerusalem, and the residue,
after having been hunted through the mountains, descended
into the plain of Ramleh, where they were attacked by the
Carizmians, and only three hundred out of the whole number
succeeded in reaching Jaffa in safety. All the women and children
had been taken captive in the mountains, and amongst them
were several holy nuns, who were sent to Egypt and sold in the
common slave-markets.</p>

<p>The Carizmians had advanced into the plain of Ramleh by
way of Baalbec, Tiberias, and Naplous, and they now directed
their footsteps towards Jerusalem. They entered the Holy City
sword in hand, massacred the few remaining Christians in the
church of the Holy Sepulchre, pillaged the town, and rifled the
tombs of the kings for treasure. They then marched upon Gaza,
stormed the city, and put the garrison to the sword, after which
they sent messengers across the desert to the sultan of Egypt
to announce their arrival. Ayoub immediately sent a robe of
honour and sumptuous gifts to their chief, and despatched his
army from Cairo in all haste, under the command of Rokmeddin
Bibars, one of his principal Mamlooks, to join them before Gaza.
The Grand Masters of the Temple and the Hospital, on the
other hand, collected their forces together, and made a junction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
with the troops of the sultan of Damascus and the lord of Carac.
They marched upon Gaza, attacked the united armies of the
Egyptians and Carizmians, and were exterminated in a bloody
battle of two days’ continuance. The Grand Master of the
Temple and the flower of his chivalry perished in that bloody
encounter, and the Grand Master of the Hospital was taken
prisoner, and led away into captivity.<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>The government of the order of the Temple, in consequence
of the death of the Grand Master, temporarily devolved upon
the Knight Templar, Brother William de Rochefort, who immediately
despatched a melancholy letter addressed to the pope and
the archbishop of Canterbury, detailing the horrors and atrocities
of the Carizmian invasion. “These perfidious savages,”
says he, “having penetrated within the gates of the holy city of
Israel, the small remnant of the faithful left therein, consisting
of children, women, and old men, took refuge in the church of
the sepulchre of our Lord. The Carizmians rushed to that
holy sanctuary; they butchered them all before the very sepulchre
itself, and cutting off the heads of the priests who were
kneeling with uplifted hands before the altars, they said one to
another, ‘Let us here shed the blood of the Christians <i>on the
very place where they offer up wine to their <span class="smcap">God</span>, who they say was
hanged here</i>.’ Moreover, in sorrow be it spoken, and with sighs
we inform you, that laying their sacrilegious hands on the very
sepulchre itself, they sadly knocked it about, utterly battering to
pieces the marble shrine which was built around that holy sanctuary.
They have defiled, with every abomination of which they
were capable, Mount Calvary, where Christ was crucified, and
the whole church of the resurrection. They have taken away,
indeed, the sculptured columns which were placed as a decoration
before the sepulchre of the Lord; and, as a mark of victory,
and as a taunt to the Christians, they have sent them to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
sepulchre of the wicked Mahomet. They have violated the
tombs of the happy kings of Jerusalem in the same church, and
they have scattered, to the hurt of Christendom, the ashes of
those holy men to the winds, irreverently profaning the revered
Mount Sion. The Temple of the Lord, the church of the
Valley of Jehoshaphat, where the Virgin lies buried, the church
of Bethlehem, and the place of the nativity of our Lord, they
have polluted with enormities too horrible to be related, far exceeding
the iniquity of all the Saracens, who, though they frequently
occupied the land of the Christians, yet always reverenced
and preserved the holy places....” The subsequent
military operations are then described; the march of the Templars
and Hospitallers, on the 4th of October, <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1244, from
Acre to Cæsarea; the junction of their forces with those of the
Moslem sultans; the retreat of the Carizmians to Gaza, where
they received succour from the sultan of Egypt; and the preparation
of the Hospitallers and Templars for the attack before
that place. “Those holy warriors,” say they, “boldly rushed
in upon the enemy, but the Saracens who had joined us, having
lost many of their men, fled, and the warriors of the cross were
left alone to withstand the united attack of the Egyptians and
Carizmians. Like stout champions of the Lord, and true defenders
of catholicity, whom the same faith and the same cross
and passion make true brothers, they bravely resisted; but as
they were few in number in comparison with the enemy, they at
last succumbed, so that of the convents of the house of the
chivalry of the Temple, and of the house of the hospital of St.
John at Jerusalem, only thirty-three Templars and twenty-six
Hospitallers escaped; the archbishop of Tyre, the bishop of St.
George, the abbot of St. Mary of Jehoshaphat, and the Master
of the Temple, with many other clerks and holy men, being
slain in that sanguinary fight. We ourselves, having by our
sins provoked this dire calamity, fled half dead to Ascalon;
from thence we proceeded by sea to Acre, and found that city and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
the adjoining province filled with sorrow and mourning, misery
and death. There was not a house or a family that had not lost
an inmate or a relation....</p>

<p>“The Carizmians have now pitched their tents in the plain
of Acre, about two miles from the city. They have spread themselves
over the whole face of the country as far as Nazareth and
Saphet. They have slaughtered or driven away the house-holders,
occupied their houses, and divided their property
amongst them. They have appointed bailiffs and tax-gatherers
in the towns and villages, and they compel the countrymen and
the villeins of the soil to pay to themselves the rents and tribute
which they have heretofore been wont to pay to the Christians,
so that the church of Jerusalem and the christian kingdom have
now no territory, except a few fortifications, which are defended
with great difficulty and labour by the Templars and Hospitallers....
To you, dear Father, upon whom the burthen
of the defence of the cause of Christ justly resteth, we have
caused these sad tidings to be communicated, earnestly beseeching
you to address your prayers to the throne of grace, imploring
mercy from the Most High; that he who consecrated the Holy
Land with his own blood in redemption of all mankind, may
compassionately turn towards it and defend it, and send it
succour. But know, assuredly, that unless, through the interposition
of the Most High, or by the aid of the faithful, the
Holy Land is succoured in the next spring passage from
Europe, its doom is sealed, and utter ruin is inevitable. Given
at Acre, this fifth day of November, in the year of our Lord one
thousand two hundred and forty-four.”<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>The above letter was read before a general council of the
church, which had been assembled at Lyons by pope Innocent
IV., and it was resolved that a new crusade should be preached.
It was provided that those who assumed the cross should
assemble at particular places to receive the pope’s blessing; that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
there should be a truce for four years between all christian
princes; that during all that time there should be no tournaments,
feasts, nor public rejoicings; that all the faithful in
Christ should be exhorted to contribute, out of their fortunes
and estates, to the defence of the Holy Land; and that ecclesiastics
should pay towards it the tenth, and cardinals the
twentieth, of all their revenues, for the term of three years successively.
The ancient enthusiasm, however, in favour of distant
expeditions to the East had died away; the addresses and
exhortations of the clergy now fell on unwilling ears, and the
Templars and Hospitallers, for several years, received only some
small assistance in men and money. The emperor Frederick,
who still bore the empty title of king of Jerusalem, made no
attempt to save the wreck of his feeble kingdom. His bride, the
fair and youthful Violante, queen of the Latin kingdom, had been
dead several years, killed by his coldness and neglect; and the
emperor bestowed no thought upon his eastern subjects and the
Holy Land, except to abuse those by whom that land had been
so gallantly defended. In a letter to Richard earl of Cornwall, the
brother of Henry the Third, king of England, Frederick accuses
the Templars of making war upon the sultan of Egypt, in defiance
of a treaty entered into with that monarch, of compelling him to
call in the Carizmians to his assistance; and he compares the
union of the Templars with the infidel sultan, for purposes of
defence, to an attempt to extinguish a fire by pouring upon it a
quantity of oil. “The proud religion of the Temple,” says he,
in continuation, “nurtured amid the luxuries of the barons of
the land, waxeth wanton. It hath been made manifest to us,
by certain religious persons lately arrived from parts beyond
sea, that the aforesaid sultans and their trains were received
with pompous alacrity within the gates of the houses of the
Temple, and that the Templars suffered them to perform within
them their superstitious rites and ceremonies, with invocation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
of Mahomet, and to indulge in secular delights.”<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> In the
midst of all these terrible disasters, a general chapter of
Knights Templars was assembled in the Pilgrim’s Castle, and the
veteran warrior, Brother <span class="smcap">William de Sonnac</span>, was chosen (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1247)
Grand Master of the Order.<a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> Circular mandates were, at the
same time, sent to the western preceptories, summoning all the
brethren to Palestine, and directing the immediate transmission
of all the money in the different treasuries to the head-quarters
of the Order at Acre. These calls were promptly attended to,
and the pope praises both the Templars and Hospitallers for
the zeal and energy displayed by them in sending out the newly
admitted knights and novices with armed bands and a large
amount of treasure to the succour of the holy territory.</p>

<p>Whilst the proposed crusade was slowly progressing, the holy
pontiff wrote to the sultan of Egypt, the ally of the Carizmians,
proposing a peace or a truce, and received the following grand
and magnificent reply to his communication:&mdash;“To the pope,
the noble, the great, the spiritual, the affectionate, the holy, the
thirteenth of the apostles, the leader of the sons of baptism, the
high priest of the Christians, (may God strengthen him and
establish him, and give him happiness!) from the most powerful
sultan ruling over the necks of nations; wielding the two
great weapons, the sword and the pen; possessing two pre-eminent
excellencies&mdash;that is to say, learning and judgment;
king of two seas; ruler of the South and North; king of the
region of Egypt and Syria, Mesopotamia, Media, Idumea, and
Ophir; king Saloph Beelpheth, Jacob, son of Sultan Kamel,
Hemevafar Mehameth, son of Sultan Hadel, Robethre, son of
Jacob, whose kingdom may the Lord God make happy.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">In the name of God the most merciful and compassionate.</span>
The letters of the pope, the noble, the great, &amp;c., &amp;c., have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
presented to us. May God favour him who earnestly seeketh
after righteousness and doeth good, and wisheth peace, and
walketh in the ways of the Lord. May God assist him who
worshippeth him in truth. We have considered the aforesaid
letters, and have understood the matters treated of therein, which
have pleased and delighted us; and the messenger sent by the
holy pope came to us, and we caused him to be brought before
us with honour, and love, and reverence; and we brought him
to see us face to face, and inclining our ears towards him, we
listened to his speech, and we have put faith in the words he
hath spoken unto us concerning Christ, upon whom be salvation
and praise. But we know more concerning that same Christ
than ye know, and we magnify him more than ye magnify him.
And as to what you say concerning your desire for peace, tranquillity,
and quiet, and that you wish to put down war, so also
do we; we desire and wish nothing to the contrary. But let
the pope know, that between ourselves and the emperor (Frederick)
there hath been mutual love, and alliance, and perfect
concord, from the time of the sultan, my father, (whom may
God preserve and place in the glory of his brightness!) and
between you and the emperor there is, as ye know, strife and
warfare; whence it is not fit that we should enter into any treaty
with the Christians until we have previously had his advice and
assent. We have therefore written to our envoy at the imperial
court upon the propositions made to us by the pope’s messenger,
&amp;c.... This letter was written on the seventh of the
month <i>Maharan</i>. Praise be to the one only God, and may his
blessing rest upon our master, <i>Mahomet</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>In the course of a few years the Carizmians were annihilated.
The sultan of Egypt having no further need of their services,
left them to perish in the lands they had wasted. They were
attacked by the sultans of Aleppo and Hems, and were pursued
with equal fury by Moslems and by Christians. Several large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
bodies of them were cut up in detail by the Templars and
Hospitallers, and they were at last slain to a man. Their very
name perished from the face of the earth, but the traces of their
existence were long preserved in the ruin and desolation they
had spread around them.<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> The Holy Land, although happily
freed from the destructive presence of these barbarians, had yet
everything to fear from the powerful sultan of Egypt, with
whom hostilities still continued; and Brother William de Sonnac,
the Grand Master of the Temple, for the purpose of stimulating
the languid energies of the English nation, and reviving
their holy zeal and enthusiasm in the cause of the cross, despatched
a distinguished Knight Templar to England, charged
with the duty of presenting to king Henry the Third a magnificent
crystal vase, containing, as it was alleged, a portion of the
blood of Jesus Christ!</p>

<p>A solemn attestation of the genuineness of this precious relic,
signed by the patriarch of Jerusalem, and the bishops, abbots,
and barons of the Holy Land, was forwarded to London, and
was deposited, together with the vase and its contents, in the
cathedral church of St. Paul. The king ordered the bishops
and clergy devoutly and reverently to assemble at St. Paul’s,
on the anniversary of the translation of St. Edward the Confessor,
in full canonicals, with banners, crosses, and lighted
wax-candles. On the eve of that day, according to the monk
of St. Albans, who personally assisted at the ceremony, “our
lord the king, with a devout and contrite spirit, as became that
most christian prince, fasting on bread and water, and watching
all night with a great light, and performing many pious exercises,
prudently prepared himself for the morrow’s solemnity.”
On the morrow a procession of bishops, monks, and priests,
having been duly marshalled and arranged, king Henry made
his appearance upon the steps at the south door of St. Paul’s
cathedral, and receiving with “the greatest honour, and rever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>ence,
and fear, the little vase containing the memorable treasure,
he bore it publicly through the streets of London, holding it
aloft just above his face. Bareheaded, and clothed in a humble
habit, he walked afoot without halting, to Westminster Abbey;
and although he passed over rough and uneven pavements,
yet he invariably kept his eyes stedfastly fixed, either on heaven
or on that vase.” He made a solemn procession round the
Abbey, then round the palace at Westminster, and then round
his own bed-chamber, all the while unweariedly bearing aloft
the precious relic, after which he presented it to God, and the
church of St. Peter, to his dear Edward, and the sacred convent
at Westminster.<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>In the mean time the Comans, another fierce pastoral tribe of
wandering Tartars, made their way through the christian province
of Armenia into the principality of Antioch, and ravaged
both banks of the Orontes, carrying away the inhabitants into
captivity. The king of Armenia and the prince of Antioch
despatched messengers to the Templars and Hospitallers for
succour; and the Grand Masters, collecting all their disposable
forces, hurried to the relief of the distressed provinces. In a
long and bloody battle, fought in the neighbourhood of the iron
bridge over the Orontes, the Comans were overthrown and
slaughtered, and the vast and wealthy city of Antioch was saved
from pillage. The Hospitallers suffered severe loss in this
engagement, and Brother Bertrand de Comps, their Grand
Master, died of his wounds four days after the battle.</p>

<p>In the month of June, <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1249, the galleys of the Templars
left Acre with all their disposable forces on board, under the
command of the Grand Master William de Sonnac, and joined
the great French expedition of Louis king of France which had
been directed against the infidels in Egypt. After the capture
of Damietta, the following letter was forwarded by Brother
William de Sonnac to the Master of the Temple at London:&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>“Brother
William de Sonnac, by the grace of God Master of
the poor chivalry of the Temple, to his beloved brother in
Christ, Robert de Sanford, Preceptor of England, salvation
through the Lord. We hasten to unfold to you by these presents,
agreeable and happy intelligence.... (He details the
landing of the French, the defeat of the infidels with the loss of
one christian soldier, and the subsequent capture of the city.)
Damietta, therefore, has been taken, not by our deserts, nor by
the might of our armed bands, but through the divine power
and assistance. Moreover, be it known to you that king Louis,
with God’s favour, proposes to march upon Alexandria or Cairo
for the purpose of delivering our brethren there detained in
captivity, and of reducing, with God’s help, the whole land to
the christian worship. Farewell.”<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>The Lord de Joinville, the friend of king Louis, and one of
the bravest of the French captains, gives a lively and most
interesting account of the campaign, and of the exploits of the
Templars. During the march towards Cairo, they led the van
of the christian army, and on one occasion, when the king of
France had given strict orders that no attack should be made
upon the infidels, and that an engagement should be avoided, a
body of Turkish cavalry advanced against them. “One of
these Turks,” says Joinville, “gave a Knight Templar in the
first rank so heavy a blow with his battle-axe, that it felled him
under the feet of the Lord Reginald de Vichier’s horse, who
was Marshal of the Temple; the Marshal, seeing his man fall,
cried out to his brethren, ‘At them in the name of God, for I
cannot longer stand this.’ He instantly stuck spurs into his
horse, followed by all his brethren, and as their horses were
fresh, not a Saracen escaped.” After marching for some days,
the Templars arrived on the banks of the Tanitic branch of the
Nile, (the ancient Pelusiac mouth of the river,) and found the
sultan encamped with his entire force on the opposite side, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
prevent and oppose their passage. King Louis attempted to
construct a bridge to enable him to cross the stream, and long
and earnestly did the Templars labour at the task, “but,” says
Joinville, “as fast as we advanced our bridge the Saracens destroyed
it; they dug, on their side of the river, wide and deep
holes in the earth, and as the water recoiled from our bridge it
filled these holes with water, and tore away the bank, so that what
we had been employed on for three weeks or a month they ruined
in one or two days.” To protect the soldiers employed upon
the construction of the bridge large wooden towers were erected,
and <i>chas chateils</i> or covered galleries, and the infidels exerted all
their energies to destroy them with the terrible Greek fire.
“At night,” says Joinville, “they brought forward an engine
called by them La Perriere, a dreadful engine to do mischief,
and they flung from it such quantities of Greek fire that it was
the most horrible sight ever witnessed.... This Greek
fire was like a large tun, and its tail was of the length of a long
spear; the noise which it made was like to thunder, and it
seemed a great dragon of fire flying through the air, giving so
great a light with its flame, that we saw in our camp as clearly as
in broad day.”</p>

<p>The military engines and machines were all burnt, and the
Christians were about to yield themselves up to despair, when a
Bedouin Arab offered, for a bribe of five hundred golden bezants,
to show a safe ford. At dawn of day, on Shrove Tuesday, the
French knights mounted on horseback to make trial of the ford
of the Bedouin. “Before we set out,” says Joinville, “the king
had ordered that the Templars should form the van, and the
Count d’Artois, his brother, should command the second division
after the Templars; but the moment the Count d’Artois
had passed the ford, he and all his people fell on the Saracens,
and putting them to flight, galloped after them. The Templars
sent to call the Count d’Artois back, and to tell him that it was
his duty to march behind and not before them; but it happened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
that the Count d’Artois could not make any answer by reason
of my Lord Foucquault du Melle, who held the bridle of his
horse, and my Lord Foucquault, who was a right good knight,
being deaf, heard nothing the Templars were saying to the
Count d’Artois, but kept bawling out, ‘<i>Forward! forward!</i>’ (‘Or
a eulz! or a eulz!’) When the Templars perceived this, they
thought they should be dishonoured if they allowed the Count
d’Artois thus to take the lead; so they spurred their horses
more and more, and faster and faster, and chased the Turks,
who fled before them, through the town of Mansourah, as far as
the plains towards Babylon.”<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>The Arabian writers, in their account of the entry of the
Templars into Mansourah, tell us that 2,000 horsemen galloped
into the place sword in hand and surprised Fakho’ddin Othman,
commonly called Ibn Saif, the Moslem general, and one of the
principal Mamlook emirs, in the bath, and barbarously cut him
to pieces as he was painting his beard before a glass.<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> But the
impetuous courage of the Count d’Artois and the Templars had
led them far away from the support of the main body of the
army, and their horsemen became embarrassed in the narrow
streets of Mansourah, where there was no room to charge or
manœuvre with effect. The infidels rallied; they returned to
the attack with vast reinforcements; the inhabitants of the town
mounted to their house-tops, and discharged stones and brickbats
upon the heads of the christian knights, and the Templars
were defeated and driven out of the city with dreadful carnage.
“The Count d’Artois and the Earl of Leicester were there slain,
and as many as three hundred other knights. The Templars
lost, as their chief informed me, full fourteen score men-at-arms,
and all their horsemen.” The Grand Master of the Temple
also lost an eye, and cut his way through the infidels to the
main body of the christian army, accompanied only by two
Knights Templars. There he again mixed in the affray, took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
the command of a vanguard, and is to be found fighting by the
side of the lord de Joinville at sunset.</p>

<p>At the close of the long and bloody day, the Christians regained
their camp in safety. King Louis, Joinville, and the
Grand Master of the Temple had been fighting side by side
during a great part of the afternoon; Joinville had his horse
killed under him, and performed prodigies of valour. He was
severely wounded, and on retiring to his quarters he found that
a magnificent tent had been sent to him by the Grand Master of
the Temple, as a testimony of regard and esteem. On the first
Friday in Lent, Bendocdar, the great Mamlook general and
lieutenant of the sultan of Egypt, advanced at the head of a vast
army of horse and foot to attack the Crusaders in their intrenchments.
King Louis drew out his army in battle array,
and posted them in eight divisions in front of the camp. The
Templars, under their venerable Grand Master, formed the
fourth division, and the fate of their gallant chieftain is thus
described by the lord de Joinville. “The next battalion was
under the command of Brother William de Sonnac, Master of
the Temple, who had with him the small remnant of the brethren
of his order who survived the battle of Shrove Tuesday.
The Master of the Temple made of the engines which he had
taken from the Saracens a sort of rampart in his front, but when
the Saracens marched up to the assault, they threw Greek fire
upon it, and as the Templars had piled up many planks of
fir-wood amongst these engines, they caught fire immediately;
and the Saracens, perceiving that the brethren of the Temple
were few in number, dashed through the burning timbers, and
vigorously attacked them. In the preceding battle of Shrove
Tuesday, Brother William, the Master of the Temple, lost one
of his eyes, and in this battle the said lord lost his other eye,
and was slain. God have mercy on his soul! And know that
immediately behind the place where the battalion of the Templars
stood, there was a good acre of ground, so covered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
darts, arrows, and missiles, that you could not see the earth
beneath them, such showers of these had been discharged
against the Templars by the Saracens.”<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>The command over the surviving brethren of the order now
devolved upon the Marshal, Brother Reginald de Vichier, who,
collecting together the small surviving remnant of the Templars,
retreated to the camp to participate in the subsequent horrors
and misfortunes of the campaign. “At the end of eight or ten
days,” says Joinville, “the bodies of those who had been slain
and thrown into the Nile rose to the top of the water. These
bodies floated down the river until they came to the small
bridge that communicated with each part of our army; the arch
was so low that it prevented the bodies from passing underneath,
and the river was consequently covered with them from bank to
bank, so that the water could not be seen.... God knows
how great was the stench. I never heard that any who were
exposed to this infectious smell ever recovered their health.
The whole army was seized with a shocking disorder, which
dried up the flesh on our legs to the bone; and our skins
became tanned as the ground, or like an old boot that has long
lain behind a coffer.... The barbers were forced to cut
away very large pieces of flesh from the gums to enable their
patients to eat; it was pitiful to hear the cries and groans, they
were like the cries of women in labour.”</p>

<p>The army attempted to retreat when retreat was almost impossible;
the soldiers became dispersed and scattered; thousands
died by the way-side, and thousands fell alive into the
hands of the enemy, among which last were the king and
Joinville. They were both attacked by the disease, and king
Louis laid himself down to die in an Arab hut, where he was
found and kindly treated by the Saracens. Reginald de Vichier,
the Marshal of the Templars, and a few of his brethren, reached
Damietta in safety, and took measures for the defence of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
place. All those of the prisoners who were unable to redeem
their lives by services as slaves to the conquerors, or by ransom,
were inhumanly massacred, and a grim circle of christian heads
decorated the walls and battlements of Cairo. The Egyptians
required as the price of the liberty of the French monarch the
surrender of all the fortresses of the order of the Temple in
Palestine; but the king told them that the Templars were not
subject to his command, nor had he any means of compelling
them to give effect to such an agreement. Louis and his friend
Joinville at last obtained their deliverance from captivity by the
surrender of Damietta, and by the payment of two hundred
thousand pieces of gold; and the liberation of the king’s brother,
and of the other captive nobles and knights was to be
purchased by the payment of a similar sum. The king immediately
went on board the French fleet which was at anchor
before Damietta, and exerted himself to raise the residue of the
ransom; and all Saturday and Sunday were employed in collecting
it together.</p>

<p>“On Sunday evening,” says Joinville, “the king’s servants,
who were occupied in counting out the money, sent to say that
there was a deficiency of thirty thousand livres. I observed to
the king that we had better ask the commander and Marshal of
the Temple, since the Master was dead, to give us the thirty
thousand livres. Brother Stephen d’Otricourt, knight commander
of the Temple, hearing the advice I gave to the king,
said to me, ‘Lord de Joinville, the counsel you give the king is
not right nor reasonable, for you know that we receive every
farthing of our money on our oaths;’ and Brother Reginald de
Vichier, who was Marshal of the Temple, said to the king,
‘Sire, it is as our commander has said, we cannot dispose of
any of the money intrusted to us but for the means intended,
in accordance with the rules of our institution, without being
perjured. Know that the seneschal hath ill advised you to take
our money by force, but in this you will act as you please;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
should you, however, do so, <i>we will make ourselves amends out of
the money you have in Acre</i>.’ I then told the king that if he
wished I would go and get the money, and he commanded me
so to do. I instantly went on board one of the galleys of the
Templars, and demanded of the treasurer the keys of a coffer
which I saw before me. They refused, and I was about to break
it open with a wedge in the king’s name, when the Marshal,
observing I was in earnest, ordered the keys to be given to me.
I opened the coffer, took out the sum wanting, and carried it to
the king, who was much rejoiced at my return.” King Louis
returned with the Templars to Palestine; and was received with
great distinction by the order at Acre, where he remained four
years!</p>

<p>In the year 1251 a general chapter of Knights Templars
being assembled in the Pilgrim’s Castle, the Marshal, Brother
<span class="smcap">Reginald de Vichier</span>, who had commanded with great skill
and prudence in Egypt after the death of Brother William de
Sonnac, was chosen to fill the vacant dignity of Grand Master.
Henry III., king of England, had assumed the cross shortly
after intelligence had been conveyed to England of the horrors
and atrocities committed by the Carizmians in the Holy City.
Year after year, he had promised to fulfil his vow, and the pope
issued numerous bulls, kindly providing for the tranquillity
and security of his dominions during his absence, and ordered
prayers to be offered up to God for the success of his arms, in
all the churches of Christendom. King Henry assembled a
parliament to obtain the necessary supplies, and fixed the 24th
day of June, <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1255, as the period of his departure. His
knights and barons, however, refused him the necessary funds,
and the needy monarch addressed the military orders of the
Temple and the Hospital in the following very curious letter.
“As you are said to possess a well-equipped fleet, we beseech
you to set apart for our own use some of your strongest vessels,
and have them furnished and equipped with provisions, sailors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
and all things requisite for a twelvemonth’s voyage, so that we
may be able, ere the period for our own departure arrives, to
freight them with the soldiers, arms, horses, and munitions of
war that we intend to send to the succour of the Holy Land.
You will also be pleased to provide secure habitations and suitable
accommodation for the said soldiers and their equipage,
until the period of our own arrival. You will then be good
enough to send back the same vessels to England to conduct
ourselves and suite to Palestine; and by your prompt obedience
to these our commands, we shall judge of your devotion to the
interests of the Holy Land, and of your attachment to our person.”<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>King Louis, in the mean time, assisted the Templars in
repairing the fortifications of Jaffa and Cæsarea. The lord de
Joinville who was with him tells us that the scheik of the
assassins, who still continued to pay tribute to the Templars,
sent ambassadors to the king to obtain a remission of the
tribute. He gave them an audience, and declared that he would
consider of their proposal. “When they came again before
the king,” says Joinville, “it was about vespers, and they found
the Master of the Temple on one side of him, and the Master
of the Hospital on the other. The ambassadors refused to
repeat what they had said in the morning, but the Masters of
the Temple and the Hospital commanded them so to do. Then
the Masters of the Temple and Hospital told them that their
lord had very foolishly and impudently sent such a message to
the king of France, and had they not been invested with the
character of ambassadors, they would have thrown them into
the filthy sea of Acre, and have drowned them in despite of
their master. ‘And we command you,’ continued the Masters,
‘to return to your lord, and to come back within fifteen days
with such letters from your prince, that the king shall be contented
with him and with you.’” The ambassadors accordingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
did as they were bid, and brought back from their scheik a
shirt, the symbol of friendship, and a great variety of rich
presents, “crystal elephants, pieces of amber, with borders of
pure gold,” &amp;c., &amp;c. “You must know that when the ambassadors
opened the case containing all these fine things, the
whole apartment was instantly embalmed with the odour of
their sweet perfumes.”</p>

<p>The treaty entered into between king Louis and the infidels
having been violated by the murder of the sick at Damietta, and
by the detention, in a state of slavery, of many knights and soldiers,
as well as of a large body of christian children, the Templars
recommenced hostilities, and marched with Joinville and the
French knights against the strong castle of Panias, and after an
obstinate resistance, carried the place sword in hand. The
sultan of Damascus immediately took the field; he stormed the
Temple fort Dok, slaughtered the garrison, and razed the fortifications
to the ground; the castle of Ricordane shared the same
fate, and the city of Sidon was taken by assault, (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1254,)
whilst the workmen and artificers were diligently employed in
rebuilding the walls; eight hundred men were put to the sword,
and four hundred masons and artificers were taken prisoners and
carried off to Damascus. After residing nearly two years at Acre,
and spending vast sums of money upon the defences of the maritime
towns of Palestine, king Louis returned to France. He
set sail from Acre on the 24th of April, with a fleet of fourteen
sail, his ship being steered by Brother Rèmond, the pilot of the
Grand Master of the Temple, who was charged to conduct the
king across the wide waters in safety to his own dominions. On
his arrival in France, Louis manifested his esteem for the Templars
by granting them the château and lordship of Bazèes, near
Bauvez, in Aquitaine. The deed of gift is expressed to be made
in consideration of the charitable works which the king had
seen performed amongst the Templars, and in acknowledgment
of the services they had rendered to him, and to the intent that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
he might be made a participator in the good works done by the
fraternity, and be remembered in the prayers of the brethren.
This deed was delivered on the day of Pentecost to Brother
Hugh, Grand Preceptor of Aquitaine, in the cathedral church of
Angouleme, in the presence of numerous archbishops, bishops,
counts, and barons.<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>At the period of the return of the king of France to Europe,
Henry the Third, king of England, was in Gascony with Brother
Robert de Sanford, Master of the Temple at London, who had
been previously sent by the English monarch into that province
to appease the troubles which had there broken out. King
Henry proceeded to the French capital, and was magnificently
entertained by the Knights Templars at the Temple in Paris,
which Matthew Paris tells us was of such immense extent that it
could contain within its precincts a numerous army. The day
after his arrival, king Henry ordered an innumerable quantity of
poor people to be regaled at the Temple with meat, fish, bread,
and wine; and at a later hour the king of France and all his
nobles came to dine with the English monarch. “Never,” says
Matthew Paris, “was there at any period in bygone times so
noble and so celebrated an entertainment. They feasted in the
great hall of the Temple, where hang the shields on every side,
as many as they can place along the four walls, according to the
custom of the order beyond sea....” The Knights Templars
in this country likewise exercised a magnificent hospitality, and
constantly entertained kings, princes, nobles, prelates, and
foreign ambassadors at the Temple. Immediately after the return
of king Henry to England, some illustrious ambassadors
from Castile came on a visit to the Temple at London; and as
the king “greatly delighted to honour them,” he commanded
three pipes of wine to be placed in the cellars of the Temple for
their use, and ten fat bucks to be brought them at the same
place from the royal forest in Essex. He, moreover, commanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
the mayor and sheriffs of London, and the commonalty of the
same city, to take with them a respectable assemblage of the
citizens, and to go forth and meet the said ambassadors without
the city, and courteously receive them, and honour them, and
conduct them to the Temple.<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>During the first and second years of the pontificate of pope
Alexander IV. ten bulls were published in favour of the Templars,
addressed to the bishops of the church universal, commanding
them to respect and maintain the privileges conceded
to them by the holy see; to judge and punish all persons who
should dare to exact tythe from the fraternity; to institute to the
ecclesiastical benefices of the order, all clerks presented to them
by the preceptors, without previously requiring them to make a
fixed maintenance for such clerks, and severely to punish, all
who appropriated to their own use the alms gifts and eleemosynary
donations made to the brotherhood. By these bulls the
Templars are declared to be exempt from the duty of contributing
to the travelling expenses of all nuncios and legates of the holy
see, under the dignity of a cardinal, when passing through their
territories, unless express orders to the contrary are given by
apostolic letters, and all the bishops are required earnestly and
vigorously to protect and defend the right of sanctuary accorded
the houses of the Temple.<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>In the year 1257, Brother Reginald de Vichier, the Grand
Master of the Temple, fell sick and died, at an advanced age.
He was succeeded by the English Knight Templar Brother
<span class="smcap">Thomas Berard</span>. Shortly after his election the terrible Moguls
and Tartars, those fierce vagrant tribes of shepherds and hunters,
whose victorious arms had spread terror and desolation over the
greater part of Europe and Asia, invaded Palestine, under the
command of the famous Holagou, and spread themselves like a
cloud of devouring locusts over the whole country. The Tem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>plars,
under the command of Brother Etienne de Sisi, Grand
Preceptor of Apulia, hastened to meet them, and were cut to
pieces in a sanguinary fight. The Tartars besieged and took
the rich and populous cities of Aleppo, Hamah, Hems, Damascus,
Tiberias, and Naplous, and at last entered in triumph the
holy city of Jerusalem.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> The Grand Master Brother Thomas
Berard wrote a melancholy letter to king Henry the Third for
succour. “With continual letters and many prayers,” says he,
“has our poor Christianity on this side the sea besought the
assistance of the kings and princes of this world, and above all,
the aid and succour of your majesty, imploring your royal compassion
with sighs and tears, and a loud sounding voice, and
crying out with a bitter cry in the hope that it would penetrate
the royal ear, and reach the ends of the earth, and arouse the
faithful from their slumbers, and draw them to the protection of
the Holy Land.”<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> The king of England, however, was in pecuniary
embarrassments, and unable to afford the necessary succour.
He was reduced, indeed, to the cruel necessity of borrowing
money in France upon the security of his regalia and crown
jewels, which were deposited in the Temple at Paris, as appears
from the letter of the queen of France “to her very dear brother
Henry, the illustrious king of England,” giving a long list of
golden wands, golden combs, diamond buckles, chaplets, and
circlets, golden crowns, imperial beavers, rich girdles, golden
peacocks, and rings innumerable, adorned with sapphires,
rubies, emeralds, topazes, and carbuncles, which she says she
had inspected in the presence of the treasurer of the Temple at
Paris, and that the same were safely deposited in the coffers of
the Templars.<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>In the mean time the Mamlooks, “who had breathed in their
infancy the keenness of a Scythian air,” advanced from the banks
of the Nile to contend with the Tartars for the dominion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
Palestine. Under the command of Bendocdar, the Mamlook
general, they gained a complete victory over them in the neighbourhood
of Tiberias, and drove back the stream of hostility to
the eastward of the Euphrates. Bendocdar returned to Egypt
the idol of his soldiers, and clothed with a popularity which
rendered him too powerful for a subject. He aspired to the
possession of the throne which he had so successfully defended,
and slew with his own hand his sovereign and master Kothuz,
the third Mamlook sultan of Egypt. The Mamlooks hailed him
with acclamations as their sovereign, and on the 24th day of
October, <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1260, he was solemnly proclaimed sultan of Egypt,
in the town of Salahieh in the Delta. Bendocdar was one of
the greatest men of the age, and soon proved the most formidable
enemy that the Templars had encountered in the field since
the days of Saladin. The first two years of his accession to
power were employed in the extension and consolidation of his
sway over the adjoining Mussulman countries. The holy cities
of Mecca and Medina acknowledged him for their sovereign, as
did Damascus, Aleppo, Hems, and Jerusalem. His sway extended
over Egypt, Nubia, Arabia, and Syria; and his throne
was defended by twenty-five thousand Mamlook cavalry. His
power was further strengthened by an army of one hundred
and seven thousand foot, and by the occasional aid of sixty-six
thousand Arabians.</p>

<p>After receiving the homage and submission of the rulers and
people of Aleppo, Bendocdar made a hostile demonstration
against the vast and wealthy city of Antioch; but finding the
place well defended, he retired with his army, by way of Hems,
Damascus, and Tiberias, to Egypt. The next year (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1264) he
crossed the desert at the head of thirty thousand cavalry, and overran
all Palestine up to the very gates of Acre. He burned the great
churches of Nazareth and Mount Tabor; and sought to awaken
the zeal and enthusiasm of his soldiers in behalf of Islam by
performing the pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and visiting with great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
devotion the Mosque of Omar. He then retired to Cairo with
his troops, and the Templars and Hospitallers became the assailants.
They surprised and stormed the castle of Lilion,
razed the walls and fortifications to the ground, and brought off
three hundred prisoners of both sexes, together with a rich prize
of sheep and oxen. On the 15th of June, they marched as far
as Ascalon, surprised and slew two Mamlook emirs, and put
twenty-eight of their followers to the sword. They then turned
their footsteps towards the Jordan, and on the 5th of November,
they destroyed Bisan or Scythopolis, and laid waste with fire
and sword all the valley of the Jordan, as far as the lake of
Tiberias.</p>

<p>In the depth of winter, (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1265,) Bendocdar collected his
forces together, and advanced, by rapid marches, from Egypt.
He concealed his real intentions, made a long march during the
night, and at morning’s dawn presented himself before the city
of Cæsarea. His troops descended into the ditch by means of
ropes and ladders, and climbed the walls with the aid of iron
hooks and spikes; they burst open the gates, massacred the
sentinels, and planted the standard of the prophet on the ramparts,
ere the inhabitants had time to rouse themselves from
their morning slumbers. The citadel, however, still remained
to be taken, and the garrison being forewarned, made an obstinate
defence. The Arabian writers tell us, that the citadel was
a strong and handsome fortification, erected by king Louis, and
adorned with pillars and columns. It stood on a small neck of
land which jutted out into the sea, and the ditches around the
fortress were filled with the blue waters of the Mediterranean.
Bendocdar planted huge catapults and cross-bows upon the
tower of the cathedral, and shot arrows, darts, and stones, from
them upon the battlements of the citadel. He encouraged the
exertions of his soldiers by promises of reward, and gave robes
of honour to his principal emirs. Weapons of war were distributed
in the most lavish manner, every captain of a hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
horse receiving for the use of himself and his men <i>four thousand
arrows</i>!</p>

<p>During a dark winter’s night the garrison succeeded in making
their escape, and the next morning the Moslems poured into
the citadel by thousands, and abandoned themselves to pillage.
The fortifications were levelled with the dust, and Bendocdar
assisted with his own hands in the work of demolition. He
then detached some Mamlook emirs with a body of cavalry
against Caiphas, and proceeded himself to watch the movements
of the Templars, and examine into the defences of the Pilgrim’s
Castle. Finding the place almost impregnable, and defended
by a numerous garrison, he suddenly retraced his steps to the
south, and stormed, after a brave and obstinate defence, the
strongly fortified city of Arsoof, which belonged to the Knights
Hospitallers of St. John. The greater part of the garrison was
massacred, but one thousand captives were reserved to grace
the triumph of the conqueror. They were compelled to march
at the head of his triumphal procession, with their banners reversed,
and with their crosses, broken into pieces, hung round
their necks. Bendocdar had already despatched his bravest
Mamlook generals, at the head of a considerable body of forces,
to blockade Beaufort and Saphet, two strong fortresses of the
order of the Temple, and he now advanced at the head of a
vast army to conduct the siege of the latter place in person. On
21 Ramadan, the separate timbers of his military machines
arrived from Damascus at Jacob’s bridge on the Jordan; the
sultan sent down his emirs and part of his army, with hundreds
of oxen, to drag them up the mountains to Saphet, and went
with his principal officers to assist in the transport of them.
“I worked by the sultan’s side, and aided him with all my
might,” says the cadi Mohieddin; “being fatigued, I sat down.
I began again, and was once more tired, and compelled to take
rest, but the sultan continued to work without intermission,
aiding in the transport of beams, bolts, and huge frames of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
timber.” The Grand Master of the Temple ordered out twelve
hundred cavalry from Acre to create a diversion in favour of the
besieged; but a treacherous spy conveyed intelligence to Bendocdar,
which enabled him to surprise and massacre the whole
force, and return to Saphet with their heads stuck on the
lances of his soldiers. At last, after an obstinate defence,
during which many Moslems, say the Arabian writers, obtained
the crown of martyrdom, the huge walls were thrown down, and
a breach was presented to the infidels; but that breach was so
stoutly guarded that none could be found to mount to the
assault. Bendocdar offered a reward of three hundred pieces of
gold to the first man who entered the city; he distributed robes
of honour and riches to all who were foremost in the fight, and
the outer inclosure, or first line of the fortifications was, at last,
taken.</p>

<p>The Templars retired into the citadel, but their efforts at
defence were embarrassed by the presence of a crowd of two
thousand fugitives, who had fled to Saphet for shelter, and they
agreed to capitulate on condition that the lives and liberties of
the Christians should be respected, and that they should be
transported in safety to Acre. Bendocdar acceded to these
terms, and solemnly promised to fulfil them; but as soon as he
had got the citadel into his power, he offered to all the Templars
the severe alternative of the Koran or death, and gave them
until the following morning to make their election. The preceptor
of Saphet, a holy monk and veteran warrior, assisted by
two Franciscan friars, passed the night in pious exhortations to
his brethren, conjuring them to prefer the crown of martyrdom
to a few short years of miserable existence in this sinful world,
and not to disgrace themselves and their order by a shameful
apostasy. At sunrise, on the following morning, the Templars
were led on to the brow of the hill, in front of the castle of
Saphet, and when the first rays of the rising sun gilded the
wooded summits of Mount Hermon, and the voice of the muezzin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
was heard calling the faithful to morning prayer, they were required
to join in the Moslem chaunt, <i>La-i-la i-la Allah, Mahommed
re sul Allah</i>, “There is no God but God, and Mahomet
is his apostle;” the executioners drew near with their naked
scimitars, but not a man of the noble company of knightly
warriors, say the Christian writers, would renounce his faith,
and one thousand five hundred heads speedily rolled at the feet
of Bendocdar. “The blood,” says Sanutus, “flowed down the
declivities like a rivulet of water.” The preceptor of Saphet,
the priests of the order, and brother Jeremiah, were beaten with
clubs, flayed alive, and then beheaded! The Arabian writers
state that the lives of two of the garrison were spared, one being
an Hospitaller whom the besieged had sent to Bendocdar to
negotiate the treaty of surrender, and the other a Templar,
named <i>Effreez Lyoub</i>, who embraced the Mahomedan faith, and
was circumcised and entered into the service of the sultan.<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
Immediately after the fall of Saphet, the infidels stormed the
castles of Hounin and Tebnin, and took possession of the city of
Ramleh.</p>

<p>The Grand Master of the Hospital now sued for peace, and
entered into a separate treaty with the infidels. He agreed to
renounce the ancient tribute of one hundred pieces of gold paid
to the order by the district of Bouktyr; also the annual tribute
of four thousand pieces of gold paid to them by the sultans of
Hems and Hamah; a tribute of twelve hundred pieces of gold,
fifty thousand bushels of wheat, and fifty thousand bushels of
barley annually rendered to them by the Assassins or Ismaelians
of the mountains of Tripoli: and the several tributes paid by
the cities or districts of Schayzar, Apamea, and Aintab, which
consisted of five hundred crowns of Tyrian silver, two measures
of wheat, and two pieces of silver for every two head of oxen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
pastured in the district. These terms being arranged, the emir
Fakir-eddin, and the cadi Schams-eddin were sent to receive the
oath of the Grand Master of the Hospital to fulfil them, and
a truce was then accorded him for ten years, ten days, and ten
months.</p>

<p>Bendocdar then concentrated his forces together at Aleppo,
and marched against the christian province of Armenia. The
prince of Hamah blockaded Darbesak, which was garrisoned by
the Knights Templars, and forced the mountain passes leading
into the ancient Cilicia. The Moslems then marched with
incredible rapidity to Sis, the capital of the country, which fell
into their hands after a short siege. Leon, king of Armenia,
was led away into captivity, together with his uncle, his son,
and his nephew; many others of the royal family were killed,
and some made their escape. All the castles of the Templars
in Armenia were assaulted and taken, and the garrisons massacred.
The most famous of these was the castle of Amoud,
which was stormed after an obstinate defence, and every soul
found in it was put to the sword. The city of Sis was pillaged,
and then delivered up to the flames; the inhabitants of all the
towns were either massacred or reduced to slavery; their goods
and possessions were divided amongst the soldiers, and the
Moslems returned to Aleppo laden with booty and surrounded
by captives fastened together with ropes. Great was the joy of
Bendocdar. The musicians were ordered to play, and the
dancing girls to beat the tambour and dance before him. He
made a triumphant entry into Damascus, preceded by his royal
captives and many thousand prisoners bound with chains.
“Thus did the sultan,” says the Arabian historian, “cut the
sugar-canes of the Franks!”</p>

<p>On the 1st of May, <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1267, Bendocdar collected together a
strong body of cavalry, divided them into two bodies, and caused
them to mount the banners and emblems of the Hospital and
Temple. By this ruse he attempted to penetrate the east gate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
of Acre, but the cheat was fortunately discovered, and the gates
were closed ere the Arab cavalry reached them. The infidels
then slaughtered five hundred people outside the walls, cut off
their heads and put them into sacks. Amongst them were some
poor old women who gained a livelihood by gathering herbs!
The ferocious Mamlooks then pulled down all the houses and
windmills, plucked up the vines, cut down all the fruit trees and
burnt them, and filled up the wells. Some deputies, sent to sue
for peace, were introduced to Bendocdar through a grim and
ghastly avenue of christian heads planted on the points of
lances, and their petition was rejected with scorn and contempt.
“The neighing of our horses,” said the ferocious sultan, “shall
soon strike you with deafness, and the dust raised by their feet
shall penetrate to the inmost chambers of your dwellings.”</p>

<p>On the 7th of March, <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1268, the sultan stormed Jaffa, put
the garrison to the sword, set fire to the churches, and burnt
the crucifixes and crosses and holy relics of the saints. “He
took away the head of St. George and burnt the body of St.
Christina,” and then marched against the strongly fortified city
of Beaufort, which belonged to the order of the Temple.
Twenty-six enormous military engines were planted around the
walls, and the doctors of the law and the <i>Fakirs</i>, or teachers of
religion, were invited to repair to the Moslem camp, and wield
the sword in behalf of Islam. The town was defended by two
citadels, the ancient and the new one. The former was garrisoned
by the Templars, and the latter by the native militia.
These last, after sustaining a short siege, set fire to their post
and fled during the night. “As for the other citadel,” says the
cadi Mohieddin, “it made a long and vigorous defence,” and
Bendocdar, after losing the flower of his army before the place,
was reluctantly compelled to permit the garrison to march out,
sword in hand, with all the honours of war. The fortress was
then razed to the ground so effectually that not a trace of it was
left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>The sultan now separated his army into several divisions,
which were all sent in different directions through the principality
of Tripoli to waste and destroy. All the churches and
houses were set on fire; the trees were cut down, and the inhabitants
were led away into captivity. A tower of the Templars,
in the environs of Tripoli, was taken by assault, and every soul
found in it was put to death. The different divisions of the
army were then concentrated at Hems, to collect together and
to divide their spoil. They were then again separated into
three corps, which were sent by different routes against the vast
and wealthy city of Antioch, the ancient “Queen of Syria.”
The first division was directed to take a circuitous route by way
of Darbesak, and approach Antioch from the north; the second
was to march upon Suadia, and to secure the mouth of the
Orontes, to prevent all succour from reaching the city by sea;
and the third and last division, which was led by Bendocdar in
person, proceeded to Apamea, and from thence marched down
the left bank of the river Orontes along the base of the ancient
Mons Casius, so as to approach and hem in Antioch from the
south. On the 1st Ramadan, all these different divisions were
concentrated together, and the city was immediately surrounded
by a vast army of horse and foot, which cut off all communication
between the town and the surrounding country, and exposed
a population of 160,000 souls to all the horrors of famine. The
famous stone bridge of nine arches, which spanned the Orontes,
and communicated between the city and the right bank of the
river, was immediately attacked; the iron doors which guarded
the passage were burst open with the battering-rams, and the
standard of the prophet was planted beneath the great western
gate. The Templars of the principality, under the command of
their Grand Preceptor, made a vain effort to drive back the infidels
and relieve the city. They sallied out of the town, with
the constable of Antioch, but were defeated by the Mamlook
cavalry, after a sharp encounter in the plain, and were compelled
to take refuge behind the walls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>For three days successively did the sultan vainly summon the
city to surrender, and for three days did he continue his furious
assaults. On the fourth day the Moslems scaled the walls
where they touch the side of the mountain; they rushed across
the ramparts, sword in hand, into the city, and a hundred thousand
Christians are computed to have been slain! About eight
thousand soldiers, accompanied by a dense throng of women
and children, fled from the scene of carnage to the citadel, and
there defended themselves with the energy of despair. Bendocdar
granted them their lives, and they surrendered. They
were bound with cords, and the long string of mournful captives
passed in review before the sultan, who caused the scribes and
notaries to take down the names of each of them. After several
days of pillage, all the booty was brought together in the plain
of Antioch, and equally divided amongst the Moslems; the gold
and silver were distributed by measure, and merchandize and
property of all kinds, piled up in heaps, were drawn for by lot.
The captive women and girls were distributed amongst the
soldiery, and they were so numerous that each of the slaves of
the conquerors was permitted to have a captive at his disposal.
The sultan halted for several weeks in the plain, and permitted
his soldiers to hold a large market, or fair, for the sale of their
booty. This market was attended by Jews and pedlars from all
parts of the East, who greedily bought up the rich property and
costly valuables of the poor citizens of Antioch.</p>

<p>These last might have borne with fortitude the loss of their
worldly possessions, and the luxuries of this life, but when they
were themselves put up to auction&mdash;when the mother saw her
infant child handed over to the avaricious Jew for the paltry
sum of five pieces of silver, and sold into irredeemable bondage,
the bitter cries that resounded through the plain, touched even
the hearts of the Moslems. “It was,” says the cadi Mohieddin,
“a fearful and a heart-rending sight. Even the hard stones
were softened with grief.” He tells us, that the captives were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
so numerous, that a fine hearty boy might be purchased for
<i>twelve</i> pieces of silver, and a little girl for <i>five</i>! When the work
of pillage had been completed, when all the ornaments and decorations
had been carried away from the churches, and the
lead torn from the roofs, Antioch was fired in different places,
amid the loud thrilling shouts of <span class="smcap">Allah Acbar</span>, “<span class="smcap">God</span> <i>is</i> <span class="small">VICTORIOUS</span>!”
The great churches of St. Paul and St. Peter burnt
with terrific fury for many days, and the vast and venerable city
was left without a habitation, and without an inhabitant!</p>

<p>Thus fell Antioch, one hundred and seventy years after its
recovery from the dominion of the infidels by the crusaders,
under the command of the valiant Godfrey, Boemond, and
Tancred. Near six centuries of Moslem domination have now
again rolled over the ancient Queen of the East, but the genius
of destruction which accompanied the footsteps of the armies of
the ferocious Bendocdar has ever since presided over the spot.
The once fair and flourishing capital of Syria, the ancient
“throne of the successors of Alexander, the seat of Roman
government in the east, which had been decorated by Cæsar
with the titles of free, and holy, and inviolate,” is, at this day,
nothing more than a miserable mud village; and the ancient
and illustrious church of Antioch, which, in the fourth century
of the christian era, numbered one hundred thousand persons,
now consists only of a few Greek families, who still cling to the
christian faith amid the insults and persecutions of the infidels.
Immediately after the destruction of the city, Bendocdar caused
the following letter to be written to the prince of Antioch, who
was at Tripoli: “Since not a soul has escaped to tell you what
has happened, we will undertake the pleasing task of informing
you.... We have slain all whom you appointed to defend
Antioch. We have crushed your knights beneath the feet of
our horses, and have given up your provinces to pillage: your
gold and silver have been divided amongst us by the quintal,
and four of your women have been bought and sold for a crown.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
There is not a single christian in the province that does not now
march bound before us, nor a single young girl that is not in
our possession. Your churches have been made level with the
dust, and our chariot wheels have passed over the sites of your
dwellings. If you had seen the temples of your God destroyed,
the crosses broken, and the leaves of the gospel torn and scattered
to the winds of heaven; if you had seen your Mussulman
enemy marching into your tabernacles, and immolating upon
your shrines and your altars, the priest, the deacon, and the
bishop; if you had seen your palaces delivered to the flames,
and the bodies of the dead consumed by the fire of this world,
whilst their souls were burning in the everlasting <i>fire of</i> <span class="small">HELL</span>;
doubtless, you would have exclaimed, <i>Lord, I am become but as
dust</i>; your soul would have been ready to start from its earthly
tenement, and your eyes would have rained down tears sufficient
to have extinguished the fires that we have kindled
around you.”<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>On the fall of Antioch the Templars abandoned Bagras, a
rich and flourishing town, on the road to Armenia and Cilicia,
which had belonged to the order for more than a century. This
town of the Templars, Mohieddin tells us, had long been a
source of intense anxiety and annoyance to the Moslems.
“Over and over again,” says he, “it had been attacked, but the
Templars foiled the utmost efforts of the faithful, until, at last,
Providence gave it into our hands.” The Templars also abandoned
the castles of Gaston and Noche de Rusol, and the territory
of Port Bounel, at the entrance of Armenia. The towns of
Darbesak, Sabah, Al Hadid, and the sea-port of Gabala, successively
fell into the hands of Bendocdar, and the whole country
from Tripoli to Mount Taurus was made desolate, the houses
were set on fire, the fruit trees were cut down, and the churches
were levelled with the dust. The wealthy and populous maritime
towns of Laodicea, Tripoli, Tortosa, Beirout, Tyre, and Sidon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
however, still remained to the Christians, and as these cities were
strongly fortified, and the christian fleets kept the command of
the sea, Bendocdar postponed their destruction for a brief period,
and granted separate truces to them in consideration of the payment
of large sums of money.</p>

<p>In the year 1269, a terrible famine, consequent upon the
ravages of the infidels, afflicted Syria and Palestine, and many
of those whom the sword had spared, now died of hunger.
Louis IX., king of France, being deeply affected by the intelligence
of the misfortunes of the Latin Christians, attended an
assembly of Preceptors of the Temple in France, to devise
means of forwarding succour to the Holy Land, and caused a
quantity of corn to be sent from Languedoc to Palestine. He
moreover determined to embark in another crusade, and he
induced prince Edward of England to assume the cross, and
prepare to join his standard. Bendocdar, on the other hand,
returned from Egypt to Palestine; he surprised and cut to
pieces several bands of Christians, and made his public entry
into Damascus, preceded by many hundred ghastly heads stuck
on the points of lances, and by a vast number of weeping captives
of both sexes, and of every age. He then proceeded to
Hamah and Kafarthab, and attempted to undertake the siege of
the strong fortress of Merkab, but the winter rains and the
snow on the mountain compelled him to abandon the enterprise.
He then made an attack upon the castle of the Kurds, which
belonged to the Hospitallers, but receiving intelligence of the
sailing of the expedition of king Louis, who had left the ports
of France with an army of sixty thousand men, and a fleet of
eighteen hundred vessels; he hurried with all his forces to
Egypt to protect that country against the French. Instead of
proceeding direct to the Holy Land, king Louis was unfortunately
induced to steer to Tunis. He fell a victim to the insalubrity
of the climate, and his army, decimated by sickness,
sailed back to France. Bendocdar immediately returned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
Palestine. He halted at Ascalon, and completed the destruction
of the fortifications of that place; he stormed Castel Blanc, a
fortress of the Templars, and appeared with his Mamlook
cavalry before the gates of Tripoli. He ravaged the surrounding
country, and then retired into winter quarters, leading away
many christian prisoners of both sexes into captivity. The next
year he stormed the fortified town of Safitza, and laid siege to
Hassan el Akrad, or the castle of the Kurds. His victorious
career was checked by the arrival (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1271) of prince Edward
of England, who joined the Grand Master of the Temple at the
head of a welcome reinforcement of knights and foot soldiers.
Various successes were then obtained over the infidels, and on
the 21st Ramadan, (April 23rd, <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1272,) a truce was agreed
upon for the space of ten years and ten months, as far as regarded
the town and plain of Acre, and the road to Nazareth.</p>

<p>On the 18th of June, prince Edward was stabbed with a
poisoned dagger by an assassin. Though dangerously wounded,
he struck the assailant to the ground, and caused him to be immediately
despatched by the guards. The same day the prince
made his will; it is dated at Acre, June 18, <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1272, and
Brother Thomas Berard, Grand Master of the Temple, appears
as an attesting witness. The life of the prince, however, was
happily preserved, the effects of the poison being obviated by an
antidote administered by the Grand Master of the Temple. On
the 14th of September, the prince returned to Europe, and thus
terminated the last expedition undertaken for the relief of Palestine.
Whilst prince Edward was pursuing his voyage to England,
his father, king Henry III., died, and the council of the
realm, composed of the archbishops of Canterbury and York,
and the English bishops and barons, assembled in the Temple
at London, and swore allegiance to the prince. They there
caused him to be proclaimed king of England, and, with the
consent of the queen-mother, they appointed Walter Giffard,
archbishop of York, and the earls of Cornwall and Gloucester,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
guardians of the realm. Letters were written from the Temple
to acquaint the young sovereign with the death of his father, and
many of the acts of the new government emanated from the same
place.<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>The Grand Master of the Temple, Brother Thomas Berard,
died at Acre on the 8th of April, and on the 13th of May, <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span>
1273, the general chapter of the Templars being assembled in
the Pilgrim’s Castle, chose for his successor Brother <span class="smcap">William
de Beaujeu</span>, Grand Preceptor of Apulia. The late Vice-Master,
Brother William de Poucon, was sent to Europe with Brother
Bertrand de Fox, to announce to him the tidings of his elevation
to the chief dignity of the order. The following year William
de Beaujeu, accompanied by the Grand Master of the Hospital,
proceeded to Lyons, to attend a general council which had been
summoned by the pope to provide succour for the Holy Land.
The two Grand Masters took precedence of all the ambassadors
and peers present at that famous assembly. It was determined
that a new crusade should be preached, that all ecclesiastical dignities
and benefices should be taxed to support an armament,
and that the sovereigns of Europe should be compelled by ecclesiastical
censures to suspend their private quarrels, and afford
succour to the desolate land of promise. More than a thousand
bishops, archbishops, and ambassadors from the different princes
and potentates of Europe, graced the assembly with their presence.
From Lyons, the Grand Master William de Beaujeu
proceeded to England, and called together a general chapter of
the order at London. Whilst resident at the Temple in that
city, he received payment of a large sum of money, which the
young king Edward had borrowed of the Templars during his
stay at Acre.<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>Pope Gregory X. died in the midst of his exertions for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
creation of another crusade. The enthusiasm which had been
partially awakened subsided; those who had assumed the cross
forgot their engagements, and the Grand Master of the Temple
at last returned, in sorrow and disappointment, to the far East.
He reached Acre on St. Michael’s day, <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1275, attended by a
band of Templars, drawn from the preceptories of England and
France. Shortly after his arrival Bendocdar was poisoned, and
was succeeded by his son, Malek Said. Malek Said only
mounted the throne to descend from it. He was deposed by the
rebellious Mamlooks, and the sceptre was grasped by Malek-Mansour-Kelaoun,
the bravest and most distinguished of the
emirs. As there was now no hope of recovering the towns,
castles, and territories taken by Bendocdar, the Grand Master
directed all his energies to the preservation of the few remaining
possessions of the Christians in the Holy Land. At the expiration
of the ten years’ truce, he entered into various treaties with
the infidels. One of these, called “the peace of Tortosa,” is expressed
to be made between sultan Malek-Mansour-Kelaoun, and
his son Malek-Saleh-Ali, “honour of the world and of religion,”
of the one part, and Afryz Dybadjouk, (William de Beaujeu,)
Grand Master of the order of the Templars, of the other part.
It relates to the territories and possessions of the order of the
Temple at Tortosa, and provides for their security and freedom
from molestation by the infidels. The truce is prolonged for
ten years and ten months from the date of the execution of the
treaty, (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1282,) and the contracting parties strictly bind
themselves to make no irruptions into each other’s territories
during the period. To prevent mistakes, the lands and villages,
towers, corn-mills, gardens, brooks, and plantations, belonging
to the Templars are specified and defined, together with the
contiguous possessions of the Moslems. By this treaty, the
Templars engage not to rebuild any of their citadels, towers, or
fortresses, nor to cut any new ditch or fosse in their province of
Tortosa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>Another treaty entered into between William de Beaujeu and
the infidels, is called the peace of Acre. It accords to the Christians
Caiphas and seven villages, the province of Mount Carmel
the town and citadel of Alelyet, the farms of the Hospitallers in
the province of Cæsarea, the half of Alexandretta, the village of
Maron, &amp;c., and confirms the Templars in the possessions of
Sidon and its citadel, and its fifteen cantons. By this treaty,
sultan Malek Mansour conceded to the inhabitants of Acre a
truce of ten years, ten months, and ten days; and he swore to
observe its provisions and stipulations in the presence of the
Grand Master of the Temple and the vizir Fadhad. But all
these treaties were mere delusions. Bendocdar had commenced
the ruin of the Christians, and sultan Kelaoun now proceeded to
complete it.</p>

<p>The separate truces and treaties of peace which Bendocdar had
accorded to the maritime towns of Palestine, in return for payments
of money, were encumbered with so many minute provisions
and stipulations, that it was almost impossible for the
Christians to avoid breaking them in some trifling and unimportant
particular; and sultan Kelaoun soon found a colourable
pretence for recommencing hostilities. He first broke with the
Hospitallers and stormed their strong fortress of Merkab, which
commanded the coast road from Laodicea to Tripoli. He then
sought out a pretext for putting an end to the truce which the
count of Tripoli had purchased of Bendocdar by the payment of
eleven thousand pieces of gold. He maintained that a watch-tower
had been erected on the coast between Merkab and Tortosa,
in contravention of the stipulation which forbad the erection
of new fortifications; and he accordingly marched with his
army to lay siege to the rich and flourishing city of Laodicea.
The Arabian writers tell us that Laodicea was one of the most
commercial cities of the Levant, and was considered to be the
rival of Alexandria. A terrible earthquake, which had thrown
down the fortifications, and overturned the castle at the entrance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
of the port, unfortunately facilitated the conquest of the place,
and Laodicea fell almost without a struggle. The town was
pillaged and set on fire, and those of the inhabitants who were
unable to escape by sea, were either slaughtered or reduced to
slavery, or driven out homeless wanderers from their dwellings,
to perish with hunger and grief in the surrounding wilderness.
Shortly after the fall of Laodicea, the castle of Krak, which belonged
to the Hospitallers, was besieged and stormed; the garrison
was put to the sword, and some other small places on the
sea-coast met with a similar fate.</p>

<p>On the 13th Moharran (9th of February,) <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1287, the sultan
marched against Tripoli at the head of ten thousand horse, and
thirty-three thousand foot. The separate timbers of nineteen
enormous military engines were transported in many hundred
wagons drawn by oxen; and fifteen hundred engineers and firework
manufacturers were employed to throw the terrible Greek
fire and combustible materials, contained in brass pots, into the
city. After thirty-four days of incessant labour, the walls were
undermined and thrown into the ditch, and the engineers poured
an incessant stream of Greek fire upon the breach, whilst the
Moslems below prepared a path for the cavalry. Brother John
de Breband, Preceptor of the Temple at Tripoli, fought upon
the ramparts with a few knights and serving brethren of the
order; but they were speedily overthrown, and the Arab cavalry
dashed through the breach into the town. Upwards of one
thousand Christians fell by the sword, and the number of captives
was incalculable. Twelve hundred trembling women and
children were crowded together for safety in a single magazine
of arms, and the conquerors were embarrassed with the quantity
of spoil and booty. More than four thousand bales of the richest
silks were distributed amongst the soldiers, together with ornaments
and articles of luxury and refinement, which astonished
the rude simplicity of the Arabs. When the city had been
thoroughly ransacked, orders were issued for its destruction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
Then the Moslem soldiers were to be seen rushing with torches
and pots of burning naphtha to set fire to the churches, and the
shops, and the warehouses of the merchants; and Tripoli was
speedily enveloped in one vast, fearful, wide-spreading conflagration.
The command for the destruction of the fortifications was
likewise issued, and thousands of soldiers, stonemasons, and
labourers, were employed in throwing down the walls and towers.
The Arabian writers tell us that the ramparts were so wide that
three horsemen could ride abreast upon them round the town.
Many of the inhabitants had escaped by sea during the siege,
and crowds of fugitives fled before the swords of the Moslems, to
take refuge on the little island of Saint Nicholas at the entrance
of the port. They were there starved to death; and when Abulfeda
visited the island a few days after the fall of Tripoli, he
found it covered with the dead bodies of the unburied Christians.
Thus fell Tripoli, with its commerce, its silk manufactories,
churches, and public and private buildings. Everything that
could contribute to prosperity in peace, or defence in war,
perished beneath the sword, the hammer, and the pick-axe of
the Moslems. In the time of the crusaders, the port was
crowded with the fleets of the Italian republics, and carried on a
lucrative trade with Marseilles, Amalfi, Genoa, Pisa, Venice, and
the cities of the Grecian islands; but the rich stream of commerce
hath never since revisited the inhospitable shore.</p>

<p>Shortly after the fall of Tripoli, Gabala, Beirout, and all the
maritime towns and villages between Sidon and Laodicea, fell
into the hands of the infidels; and sultan Kelaoun was preparing
to attack the vast and populous city of Acre, when death terminated
his victorious career. He was succeeded, <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1291, by
his eldest son, Aschraf Khalil, who hastened to execute the warlike
projects of his father. He assembled the ulemas and cadis
around his father’s tomb, and occupied himself in reading the
Koran, in prayer, and invocation of Mahomet. He then made
abundant alms-giving, collected his troops together, and marched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
across the desert to Damascus, where he was joined by Hosam-eddin
Ladjin, viceroy of Syria, Modaffer, prince of Hems, and
Saifeddin, lord of Baalbec, with the respective forces under their
command. Ninety-two enormous military engines had been
constructed at Damascus, which were transported across the
country by means of oxen; and in the spring of the year, after
the winter rains had subsided, sultan Khalil marched against
Acre at the head of sixty thousand horse, and a hundred and
forty thousand foot.</p>

<p>After the loss of Jerusalem, the city of Acre became the
metropolis of the Latin Christians, and was adorned with a vast
cathedral, with numerous stately churches, and elegant buildings,
and with acqueducts, and an artificial port. The houses
of the rich merchants were decorated with pictures and choice
pieces of sculpture, and boasted of the rare advantage of glass
windows. An astonishing, and probably an exaggerated, account
has been given of the wealth and luxury of the inhabitants.
We read of silken canopies and curtains stretched on
cords to protect the lounger from the scorching sunbeams, of
variegated marble fountains, and of rich gardens and shady
groves, scented with the delicious orange blossom, and adorned
with the delicate almond flower; and we are told that the
markets of the city could offer the produce of every clime, and
the interpreters of every tongue. The vast and stupendous
fortifications consisted of a double wall, strengthened at proper
intervals with lofty towers, and defended by the castle called the
King’s Tower, and by the convent or fortress of the Temple.
Between the ramparts extended a large space of ground, covered
with the chateaus, villas, and gardens of the nobility of Galilee,
the counts of Tripoli and Jaffa, the lords of Tyre and Sidon,
the papal legate, the duke of Athens, and the princes of
Antioch. The most magnificent edifices within the town were,
the cathedral church of St. Andrew, the churches of St. Saba,
St. Thomas, St. Nicholas, and St. John, the tutelar saint of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
city; the abbey of St. Clare, the convents of the Knights Hospitallers
and the Knights Templars, and various monasteries
and religious houses.</p>

<p>William de Beaujeu, the Grand Master of the Temple, a
veteran warrior of a hundred fights, took the command of the
garrison, which amounted to about twelve thousand men, exclusive
of the forces of the Temple and the Hospital, and a body
of five hundred foot and two hundred horse, under the command
of the king of Cyprus. These forces were distributed along the
walls in four divisions, the first of which was commanded by
Hugh de Grandison, an English knight. The siege lasted six
weeks, during the whole of which period the sallies and the
attacks were incessant. Neither by night nor by day did the
shouts of the assailants and the noise of the military engines
cease; huge stones and beams of timber and pots of burning
tar and naphtha were continually hurled into the city; the walls
were battered from without, and the foundations were sapped by
miners, who were incessantly labouring to advance their works.
More than six hundred catapults, balistæ, and other instruments
of destruction, were directed against the fortifications; and the
battering machines were of such immense size and weight, that
a hundred wagons were required to transport the separate timbers
of one of them. Moveable towers were erected by the
Moslems, so as to overtop the walls; their workmen and advanced
parties were protected by hurdles covered with raw
hides, and all the military contrivances which the art and the
skill of the age could produce, were used to facilitate the assault.
For a long time their utmost efforts were foiled by the
valour of the besieged, who made constant sallies upon their
works, burnt their towers and machines, and destroyed their
miners. Day by day, however, the numbers of the garrison were
thinned by the sword, whilst in the enemy’s camp the places of
the dead were constantly supplied by fresh warriors from the
deserts of Arabia, animated with the same wild fanaticism in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
the cause of <i>their</i> religion as that which so eminently distinguished
the military monks of the Temple.</p>

<p>On the 4th of May, after thirty-three days of constant fighting,
the great tower considered the key of the fortifications, and
called by the Moslems “the cursed tower,” was thrown down by
the military engines. To increase the terror and distraction of
the besieged, sultan Khalil mounted three hundred drummers,
with their drums, upon as many dromedaries, and commanded
them to make as much noise as possible whenever a general
assault was ordered. From the 4th to the 14th of May the
attacks were incessant. On the 15th, the double wall was
forced, and the king of Cyprus, panic-stricken, fled in the night
to his ships, and made sail for the island of Cyprus, with all his
followers, and with near three thousand of the best men of the
garrison. On the morrow the Saracens attacked the post he
had deserted; they filled up the ditch with the bodies of dead
men and horses, piles of wood, stones, and earth, and their
trumpets then sounded to the assault. Ranged under the
yellow banner of Mahomet, the Mamlooks forced the breach,
and penetrated sword in hand to the very centre of the city;
but their victorious career and insulting shouts were there
stopped by the mail-clad Knights of the Temple and the Hospital,
who charged on horseback through the narrow streets,
drove them back with immense carnage, and precipitated them
headlong from the walls.</p>

<p>At sunrise on the following morning the air resounded with
the deafening noise of drums and trumpets, and the breach was
carried and recovered several times, the military friars at last
closing up the passage with their bodies, and presenting a wall
of steel to the advance of the enemy. Loud appeals to God,
and to Mahomet, to Jesus Christ, to the Virgin Mary, to heaven
and the saints, were to be heard on all sides; and after an
obstinate engagement from sunrise to sunset, darkness put an
end to the slaughter. The miners continued incessantly to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
advance their operations; another wide breach was opened in
the walls, and on the third day (the 18th) the infidels made the
final assault on the side next the gate of St. Anthony. The
army of the Mamlooks was accompanied by a troop of sectaries
called <i>Chagis</i>, a set of religious fanatics, whose devotion consisted
in suffering all sorts of privations, and in sacrificing
themselves in behalf of Islam. The advance of the Mamlook
cavalry to the assault was impeded by the deep ditch, which
had been imperfectly filled by the fallen ruins and by the efforts
of the soldiers, and these religious madmen precipitated themselves
headlong into the abyss and formed a bridge with their
bodies, over which the Mamlooks passed to reach the foot of the
wall. Nothing could withstand the fierce onslaught of the
Moslems. In vain were the first ranks of their cavalry laid
prostrate with the dust, and both horses and riders hurled headlong
over the ruined walls and battlements into the moat below;
their fall only facilitated the progress of those behind them,
who pressed on sword in hand over the lifeless bodies of men
and horses, to attack the faint and weary warriors guarding the
breach.</p>

<p>The Grand Masters of the Temple and Hospital fought side
by side at the head of their knights, and for a time successfully
resisted all the efforts of the enemy. But as each knight fell
beneath the keen scimitars of the Moslems, there were none in
reserve to supply his place, whilst the vast hordes of the infidels
pressed on with untiring energy and perseverance. Brother
Matthew de Clermont, Marshal of the Hospital, after performing
prodigies of valour, fell covered with wounds, and William de
Beaujeu, as a last resort, requested the Grand Master of that
order to sally out of an adjoining gateway at the head of five
hundred horse, and attack the enemy’s rear. Immediately after
the Grand Master of the Temple had given these orders, he
was himself struck down by the darts and the arrows of the
enemy; the panic-stricken garrison fled to the port, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
infidels rushed on with tremendous shouts of <i>Allah acbar!
Allah acbar!</i> “<span class="smcap">God</span> is victorious!” Thousands of panic-stricken
Christians now rushed to the sea-side, and sought
with frantic violence to gain possession of the ships and boats
that rode at anchor in the port, but a frightful storm of wind,
and rain, and lightning, hung over the dark and agitated waters
of the sea; the elements themselves warred against the poor
Christians, and the loud-pealing thunder became mingled with
the din and uproar of the assault and the clash of arms.
The boats and vessels were swamped by the surging waves; and
the bitter cries of the perishing fugitives ascended alike from
the sea and shore. Thousands fled to the churches for refuge,
but found none; they prostrated themselves before the altars,
and embraced the images of the saints, but these evidences of
idolatry only stimulated the merciless fanaticism of the Moslems,
and the Christians and their temples, their images and their
saints, were all consumed in the raging flames kindled by the
inexorable sons of Islam. The churches were set on fire, and
the timid virgin and the hardened voluptuary, the nun and the
monk, the priest and the bishop, all perished miserably before
the altars and the shrines which they had approached in the
hour of need, but which many of them had neglected in days of
prosperity and peace. The holy nuns of St. Clare, following
the example and exhortations of their abbess, mangled and disfigured
their faces and persons in a most dreadful manner, to
preserve their chastity from violation by the barbarous conquerors,
and were gloriously rewarded with the crown of martyrdom,
by the astonished and disgusted infidels, who slaughtered
without mercy the whole sisterhood!</p>

<p>Three hundred Templars, the sole survivors of their order in
Acre, had kept together and successfully withstood the victorious
Mamlooks. In a close and compact column they fought
their way, accompanied by several hundred christian fugitives,
to the convent of the Temple at Acre, and shut the gates.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
They then assembled together in solemn chapter, and appointed
the Knight Templar, Brother <span class="smcap">Gaudini</span>, Grand Master. The
Temple at Acre was surrounded by walls and towers, and was a
place of great strength, and of immense extent. It was divided
into three quarters, the first and principal of which contained
the palace of the Grand Master, the church, and the habitation
of the knights; the second, called the Bourg of the Temple,
contained the cells of the serving brethren; and the third,
called the Cattle Market, was devoted to the officers charged
with the duty of procuring the necessary supplies for the order
and its forces. The following morning very favourable terms
were offered to the Templars by the victorious sultan, and they
agreed to evacuate the Temple on condition that a galley should
be placed at their disposal, and that they should be allowed to
retire in safety with the christian fugitives under their protection,
and to carry away as much of their effects as each person
could load himself with. The Mussulman conqueror pledged
himself to the fulfilment of these conditions, and sent a standard
to the Templars, which was mounted on one of the towers of
the Temple. A guard of three hundred Moslem soldiers,
charged to see the articles of capitulation properly carried into
effect, was afterwards admitted within the walls of the convent.
Some Christian ladies and women of Acre were amongst the
fugitives, and the Moslem soldiers, attracted by their beauty,
broke through all restraint, and violated the terms of the surrender.
The enraged Templars closed and barricaded the gates
of the Temple; they set upon the treacherous infidels, and put
every one of them, “from the greatest to the smallest,” to
death. Immediately after this massacre, the Moslem trumpets
sounded to the assault, but the Templars successfully defended
themselves until the next day (the 20th). The Marshal of the
order and several of the brethren were then deputed by Gaudini
with a flag of truce to the sultan, to explain the cause of the
massacre of his guard. The enraged monarch, however, had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
sooner got them into his power, than he ordered every one of
them to be decapitated, and pressed the siege with renewed
vigour.</p>

<p>In the night, Gaudini, with a chosen band of his companions,
collected together the treasure of the order, and the ornaments
of the church, and sallying out of a secret postern of the
Temple which communicated with the harbour, they got on
board a small vessel, and escaped in safety to the island of
Cyprus. The residue of the Templars retired into the large
tower of the Temple, called “The Tower of the Master,” which
they defended with desperate energy. The bravest of the Mamlooks
were driven back in repeated assaults, and the little fortress
was everywhere surrounded with heaps of the slain. The
sultan, at last, despairing of taking the place by assault, ordered
it to be undermined. As the workmen advanced, they propped
the foundations with beams of wood, and when the excavation
was completed, these wooden supports were consumed by fire;
the huge tower then fell with a tremendous crash, and buried the
brave Templars in its ruins. The sultan set fire to the town
in four places; the walls, the towers, and the ramparts were
demolished, and the last stronghold of the christian power in
Palestine was speedily reduced to a smoking solitude.<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>A few years back, the ruins of the christian city of Acre were
well worthy of the attention of the curious. You might still
trace the remains of thirty churches; and the quarter occupied
by the Knights Templars continued to present many interesting
memorials of that proud and powerful order. “The carcass,”
says Sandys, “shows that the body hath been strong, doubly
immured; fortified with bulwarks and towers, to each wall a
ditch lined with stone, and under those, divers secret posterns.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
You would think, by the ruins, that the city consisted of divers
conjoining castles, which witness a notable defence, and an
unequal assault; and that the rage of the conquerors extended
beyond conquest; the huge walls and arches turned topsy-turvy,
and lying like rocks upon the foundation.” At the period of
Dr. Clarke’s visit to Acre, the ruins, with the exception of the
cathedral, the arsenal, the convent of the knights, and the
palace of the Grand Master, were so intermingled with modern
buildings, and in such a state of utter subversion, that it was
difficult to afford any satisfactory description of them. “Many
superb remains were observed by us,” says he, “in the pasha’s
palace, in the khan, the mosque, the public bath, the fountains,
and other parts of the town, consisting of fragments of antique
marble, the shafts and capitals of granite and marble pillars,
masses of the verd antique breccia, of the ancient serpentine,
and of the syenite and trap of Egypt. In the garden of Djezzar’s
palace, leading to his summer apartment, we saw some pillars
of variegated marble of extraordinary beauty.”</p>

<p>After the fall of Acre, the head-quarters of the Templars
were established at Limisso in the island of Cyprus, and urgent
letters were sent to Europe for succour. The armies of sultan
Kelaoun in the mean time assaulted and carried Tyre, Sidon,
Tortosa, Caiphas, and the Pilgrim’s Castle. The last three
places belonged to the Templars, and were stoutly defended,
but they were attacked by the Egyptian fleet by sea, and by
countless armies of infidels by land, and were at last involved in
the common destruction. The Grand Master, Gaudini, overwhelmed
with sorrow and vexation at the loss of the Holy Land,
and the miserable situation of his order, stripped of all its possessions
on the Asiatic continent, died at Limisso, after a short
illness, and was succeeded (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1295) by Brother <span class="smcap">James de
Molay</span>, of the family of the lords of Longvic and Raon in Burgundy.
This illustrious nobleman was at the head of the English
province of the order at the period of his election to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
dignity of Grand Master. He was first appointed Visitor-General,
then Grand Preceptor of England, and was afterwards
placed at the head of the entire fraternity. During his residence
in Britain he held several chapters or assemblies of the
brethren at the Temple at London, and at the different preceptories,
where he framed and enforced various rules and regulations
for the government of the fraternity in England.<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> Shortly
after his appointment to the office of Grand Master, he crossed
the sea to France, and had the honour of holding the infant son
of Philip le Bel at the baptismal font. He then proceeded to
Cyprus, carrying out with him a numerous body of English and
French Knights Templars, and a considerable amount of treasure.
Soon after his arrival he entered into an alliance with
the famous Casan Cham, emperor of the Mogul Tartars, king of
Persia, and the descendant or successor of Genghis Khan, and
landed in Syria with his knights and a body of forces, to join
the standard of that powerful monarch. Casan had married the
daughter of Leon, king of Armenia, a christian princess of
extraordinary beauty, to whom he was greatly attached, and who
was permitted the enjoyment and public exercise of the christian
worship. The Tartar emperor naturally became favourably
disposed towards the Christians, and he invited the Grand
Master of the Temple to join him in an expedition against the
sultan of Egypt.</p>

<p>In the spring of the year 1299, the Templars landed at
Suadia, and made a junction with the Tartar forces which were
encamped amid the ruins of Antioch. An army of thirty thousand
men was placed by the Mogul emperor under the command
of the Grand Master, and the combined forces moved up the
valley of the Orontes towards Damascus. In a great battle
fought at Hems, the troops of the sultans of Damascus and
Egypt were entirely defeated, and pursued with great slaughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
until nightfall. Aleppo, Hems, Damascus, and all the principal
cities, surrendered to the victorious arms of the Moguls, and the
Templars once again entered Jerusalem in triumph, visited the
Holy Sepulchre, and celebrated Easter on Mount Zion. Casan
sent ambassadors to the pope, and to the sovereigns of Europe,
announcing the victorious progress of his arms, soliciting their
alliance, and offering them in return the possession of Palestine.
But the Christian nations heeded not the call, and none
thought seriously of an expedition to the east excepting the
ladies of Genoa, who, frightened by an interdict which had
been laid upon their town, assumed the cross as the best means
of averting the divine indignation. The Grand Master of the
Temple advanced as far as Gaza, and drove the Saracens into
the sandy deserts of Egypt; but a Saracen chief, who had been
appointed by the Tartars governor of Damascus, instigated the
Mussulman population of Syria to revolt, and the Grand Master
was obliged to retreat to Jerusalem. He was there joined by
the Tartar general, Cotulosse, who had been sent across the
Euphrates by Casan to support him. The combined armies
were once more preparing to march upon Damascus, when the
sudden illness of Casan, who was given over by his physicians,
disconcerted all their arrangements, and deprived the Grand
Master of his Tartar forces. The Templars were then compelled
to retreat to the sea-coast and embark their forces on
board their galleys. The Grand Master sailed to Limisso, stationing
a strong detachment of his soldiers on the island of
Aradus, near Tortosa, which they fortified; but they were
speedily attacked in that position by a fleet of twenty vessels,
and an army of ten thousand men, and after a gallant defence
they were compelled to abandon their fortifications, and were
all killed or taken prisoners.<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>Thus ended the dominion of the Templars in Palestine, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
thus closed the long and furious struggle between the <span class="small">CRESCENT</span>
and the <span class="small">CROSS</span>! The few remaining Christians in the Holy
Land were chased from ruin to ruin, and exterminated. The
churches, the houses, and the fortifications along the sea-coast,
were demolished, and everything that could afford shelter and
security, or invite the approach of the crusaders from the west,
was carefully destroyed. The houses were all set on fire, the
trees were cut down and burnt, the land was everywhere laid
waste, and all the maritime country, from Laodicea to Ascalon,
was made desert. “Every trace of the Franks,” says the Arabian
chronicler, Ibn Ferat, “was removed, and thus it shall remain,
please God, till the day of judgment!”<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>Near six centuries have swept over Palestine since the termination
of the wars of the cross, and the land still continues
<i>desolate</i>. The proud memorials of past magnificence are
painfully contrasted with present ruin and decay, and the
remains of the rich and populous cities of antiquity are surrounded
by uncultivated deserts. God hath said, “I will smite
the land with a <i>curse</i>. I will bring the worst of the heathen
and they shall possess it.” “Thorns shall come up in her
palaces, nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof, and
the defenced city shall be left desolate, and the habitation forsaken,
and left like a wilderness.”</p>

<p>“The fig-tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be on
the vine; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields
shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold,
and there shall be no herd in the stall.” But brighter and
happier times are yet to come, for the Lord God hath also said,
“To the mountains of Israel, to the hills, and to the rivers, to
the valleys, and the desolate wastes, and the cities that are
forsaken, which became a prey and a derision to the heathen.
Behold I am for you, I will turn unto you, and ye shall be tilled
and sown, and I will multiply men upon you, and they shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
build up the old waste cities, the desolation of many generations!”</p>

<p>“In the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem,
and in the cities of Judah, <i>shall the flocks pass again under
the hand of him that telleth them, saith</i> <span class="smcap">the Lord</span>!”</p>

<p class="p2">It now only remains for us to relate the miserable and cruel
fate of the surviving brethren of the order of the Temple, and to
tell of the ingratitude they encountered at the hands of their
fellow-Christians in the West. After the loss of all the christian
territory in Palestine, and the destruction of every serious hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
of recovering and retaining the Holy City, the services of the
Templars ceased to be required, and men began to regard with
an eye of covetousness their vast wealth and immense possessions.
The clergy regarded with jealousy and indignation their
removal from the ordinary ecclesiastical jurisdiction, their exemption
from tithe, and the privilege they possessed of celebrating
divine service during interdict; and their hostility to the
order was manifested in repeated acts of injustice, which drew
forth many severe bulls from the Roman pontiffs.<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> The Templars,
moreover, became unpopular with the European sovereigns
and their nobles. The revenues of the former were
somewhat diminished through the immunities conceded to the
order by their predecessors, and the paternal estates of the latter
had been diminished by the grant of many thousand manors,
lordships, and fair estates to the fraternity by their pious and
enthusiastic ancestors. Considerable dislike also began to be
manifested to the annual transmission of large sums of money,
the revenues of the Templars, from the European states, to be
expended in a distant warfare in which Christendom now took
comparatively no interest.</p>

<p>Shortly after the fall of Acre, and the total loss of Palestine,
Edward I., king of England, seized and sequestered to his own
use the monies which had been accumulated by the Templars,
to forward to their brethren in Cyprus, alleging that the property
of the order had been granted to it by the kings of England,
his predecessors, and their subjects, for the defence of
the Holy Land, and that since the loss thereof, no better use
could, be made of the money than by appropriating it to the
maintenance of the poor. At the earnest request of the pope,
however, the king afterwards permitted their revenues to be
transmitted to them in the island of Cyprus in the usual manner.
King Edward had previously manifested a strong desire to
lay hands on the property of the Templars. On his return
from his victorious campaign in Wales, finding himself unable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
to disburse the arrears of pay due to his soldiers, he went with
Sir Robert Waleran and some armed followers to the Temple,
and calling for the treasurer, he pretended that he wanted to see
his mother’s jewels, which were there kept. Having been admitted
to the house, he deliberately broke open the coffers of
the Templars, and carried away ten thousand pounds with him
to Windsor Castle. His son, Edward II, on his accession to
the throne, committed a similar act of injustice. He went with
his favourite, Piers Gaveston, to the Temple, and took away
with him fifty thousand pounds of silver, with a quantity of
gold, jewels, and precious stones, belonging to the bishop of
Chester. The impunity with which these acts of violence
were committed, manifests that the Templars then no longer
enjoyed the power and respect which they possessed in ancient
times.</p>

<p>As the enthusiasm, too, in favour of the holy war diminished,
large numbers of the fraternity remained at home in their
western preceptories, and took an active part in the politics of
Europe. They interfered in the quarrels of christian princes,
and even drew their swords against their fellow-Christians.
Thus we find the members of the order taking part in the war
between the houses of Anjou and Aragon, and aiding the king
of England in his warfare against the king of Scotland. In the
battle of Falkirk, fought on the 22nd of July, <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1298, seven
years after the fall of Acre, perished both the Master of the
Temple at London, and his vicegerent the Preceptor of Scotland.
All these circumstances, together with the loss of the
Holy Land, and the extinction of the enthusiasm of the crusades,
diminished the popularity of the Templars. The rolls
of the English parliament about this time begin to teem with
complaints and petitions from the fraternity, of the infringement
of their charters, franchises, liberties, and privileges, in all parts
of the realm.<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>At the period of the fall of Acre, Philip the Fair, son of St.
Louis, occupied the throne of France. He was a needy and
avaricious monarch, and had at different periods resorted to the
most violent expedients to replenish his exhausted exchequer.
On the death of pope Benedict XI., (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1304,) he succeeded,
through the intrigues of the French Cardinal Dupré, in raising
the archbishop of Bordeaux, a creature of his own, to the pontifical
chair. The new pope removed the holy see from Rome
to France; he summoned all the cardinals to Lyons, and was
there consecrated, (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1305,) by the name of Clement V., in
the presence of king Philip and his nobles. Of the ten new
cardinals then created, <i>nine</i> were Frenchmen, and in all his acts
the new pope manifested himself the obedient slave of the
French monarch. The character of this pontiff has been
painted by the Romish ecclesiastical historians in the darkest
colours.</p>

<p>On the 6th of June, <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1306, a few months after his coronation,
he addressed letters from Bordeaux to the Grand Masters
of the Temple and Hospital at Limisso, in the island of Cyprus,
expressing his earnest desire to consult them with regard to the
measures necessary to be taken for the recovery of the Holy
Land. He tells them that they are the persons best qualified to
give advice upon the subject, and to conduct and manage the
enterprise, both from their great military experience and the
interest they had in the success of the expedition. “We order
you,” says he, “to come hither without delay, with as much
secrecy as possible, and with a very little retinue, since you will
find on this side the sea a sufficient number of your knights to
attend upon you.” The Grand Master of the Hospital declined
obeying this summons; but the Grand Master of the Temple
forthwith accepted it, and unhesitatingly placed himself in the
power of the pope and the king of France. He landed in
France, attended by sixty of his knights, at the commencement
of the year 1307, and deposited the treasure of the order, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
he had brought with him from Cyprus, in the Temple at Paris.
He was received with distinction by the king, and then took his
departure for Poictiers to have an interview with the pope.</p>

<p>The secret agents of the French king immediately circulated
various dark rumours and odious reports concerning the Templars.
According to some writers, Squin de Florian, a citizen
of Bezieres, who had been condemned to death or perpetual imprisonment
in one of the royal castles for his iniquities, was
brought before king Philip, and received a free pardon, and was
well rewarded, in return for an accusation on oath, charging the
Templars with heresy, and with the commission of the most
horrible crimes. According to others, Nosso de Florentin, an
apostate Templar, who had been condemned by the Grand Preceptor
and chapter of France to perpetual imprisonment for impiety
and crime, made in his dungeon a voluntary confession of
the sins and abominations charged against the order. Be this
as it may, upon the strength of an information sworn to by a
condemned criminal, king Philip, on the 14th of September,
despatched secret letters to all the baillis of the different provinces
in France, accusing the Templars of infidelity; of mocking
the sacred image of the Saviour; of sacrificing to idols; and
of abandoning themselves to impure practices and unnatural
crimes! “We being charged,” says he, “with the maintenance
of the faith; after having conferred with the pope, the prelates,
and the barons of the kingdom, at the instance of the inquisitor,
from the informations already laid, from violent suspicions, from
probable conjectures, from legitimate presumptions, conceived
against the enemies of heaven and earth! and because the
matter is important, and it is expedient to prove the just like
gold in the furnace, by a rigorous examination, have decreed
that the members of the order who are our subjects shall be
arrested and detained to be judged by the church, and that all
their real and personal property shall be seized into our hands!”
&amp;c. The baillis and seneschals were required accurately to in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>form
themselves, with great secrecy, and without exciting suspicion,
of the number of the houses of the Temple within their
respective jurisdictions; to provide an armed force sufficient to
overcome all resistance, and on the 13th of October to surprise
the Templars in their preceptories, and make them prisoners.
The inquisition is then directed to assemble to examine the
guilty, and to employ <span class="small">TORTURE</span> if it be necessary. “Before proceeding
with the inquiry,” says Philip, “you are to inform them
(the Templars) that the pope and ourselves have been convinced,
by irreproachable testimony, of the errors and abominations
which accompany their vows and profession; you are to promise
them <i>pardon</i> and <i>favour</i> if they <span class="small">CONFESS</span> the truth, but if
not, you are to acquaint them that they will be condemned to
death.”</p>

<p>As soon as Philip had issued these orders, he wrote to the
principal sovereigns of Europe, urging them to follow his
example, and sent a confidential agent, named Bernard Peletin,
with a letter to the young king, Edward the Second, who had
just then ascended the throne of England, representing in frightful
colours the pretended sins of the Templars. On the 22nd
of September, (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1306,) king Edward replied to this letter,
observing that he had considered of the matters mentioned
therein, and had listened to the statements of that discreet man,
Master Bernard Peletin; that he had caused the latter to unfold
the charges before himself, and many prelates, earls, and barons
of his kingdom, and others of his council; but that they appeared
so astonishing as to be beyond belief; that such abominable
and execrable deeds had never before been heard of by the
king, and the aforesaid prelates, earls, and barons, and it was
therefore hardly to be expected that an easy credence could be
given to them. The English monarch, however, informs king
Philip, that by the advice of his council he had ordered the
seneschal of Agen, from whose lips the rumours were said to
have proceeded, to be summoned to his presence, that through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
him he might be further informed concerning the premises;
and he states that, at the fitting time, after due inquiry, he will
take such steps as will redound to the praise of God, and the
honour and preservation of the catholic faith.<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>On the night of the 13th of October, all the Templars in the
French dominions were simultaneously arrested. Monks were
appointed to preach against them in the public places of Paris,
and in the gardens of the Palais Royal; and advantage was
taken of the folly, the superstition, and the credulity of the age,
to propagate the most horrible and extravagant charges against
them. They were accused of worshipping an idol covered with
an old skin, embalmed, having the appearance of a piece of
polished oil-cloth. “In this idol,” we are assured, “there were
two carbuncles for eyes, bright as the brightness of heaven, and
it is certain that all the hope of the Templars was placed in it;
it was their sovereign god, and they trusted in it with all their
heart.” They are accused of burning the bodies of the deceased
brethren, and making the ashes into a powder, which they
administered to the younger brethren in their food and drink,
to make them hold fast their faith and idolatry; of cooking and
roasting infants, and anointing their idols with the fat; of
celebrating hidden rites and mysteries, to which young and
tender virgins were introduced, and of a variety of abominations
too absurd and horrible to be named. Guillaume Paradin, in
his history of Savoy, seriously repeats these monstrous accusations,
and declares that the Templars had “un lieu creux ou
cave en terre, fort obscur, en laquelle ils avoient un image en
forme d’un homme, sur lequel ils avoient appliqué la peau d’un
corps humain, et mis deux clairs et luisans escarboucles au lieu
des deux yeux. A cette horrible statue etoient contraints de
sacrifier ceux qui vouloient etre de leur damnable religion, lesquels
avant toutes ceremonies ils contragnoient de renier Jesus Christ,
et fouler la croix avec les pieds, et apres ce maudit sacre auquel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
assistoient femmes et filles (seduites pour etre de ce secte) ils
estegnoient les lampes et lumieres qu’ils avoient en cett cave....
Et s’il advenoit que d’un Templier et d’un pucelle
nasquit un fils, ils se rangoient tous en un rond, et se jettoient
cet enfant de main en main, et ne cessoient de le jetter jusqu’a
ce qu’il fu mort entre leurs mains; etant mort ils se rotissoient
(chose execrable) et de la graisse ils en ognoient leur grand
statue!” The character of the charges preferred against the
Templars proves that their enemies had no serious crimes to
allege against the order. Their very virtues, indeed, were
turned against them, for we are told that, “to conceal the
iniquity of their lives, they made much almsgiving, constantly
frequented church, comported themselves with edification, frequently
partook of the holy sacrament, and manifested always
much modesty and gentleness of deportment in the house, as
well as in public.”</p>

<p>During twelve days of severe imprisonment, the Templars remained
constant in the denial of the horrible crimes imputed to
the fraternity. The king’s promises of pardon extracted from
them no confession of guilt, and they were therefore handed
over to the tender mercies of the brethren of St. Dominic, who
were the most refined and expert torturers of the day. On the
19th of October, the grand inquisitor proceeded with his myrmidons
to the Temple at Paris, and a hundred and forty Templars
were one after another put to the torture. Days and weeks
were consumed in the examination, and thirty-six Templars
perished in the hands of their tormentors, maintaining, with
unshaken constancy to the very last, the entire innocence of
their order! Many of them lost the use of their feet from the
application of the torture of fire, which was inflicted in the
following manner:&mdash;their legs were fastened in an iron frame,
and the soles of their feet were greased over with fat or butter;
they were then placed before the fire, and a screen was drawn
backwards and forwards, so as to moderate and regulate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
heat. Such was the agony produced by this roasting operation,
that the victim often went raving mad. Brother Bernarde de
Vado, on subsequently revoking a confession of guilt, wrung
from him by this description of torment, says to the commissary
of police, before whom he was brought to be examined, “They
held me so long before a fierce fire that the flesh was burnt off
my heels, two pieces of bone came away, which I present to
you.”<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> Another Templar, on publicly revoking his confession,
declared that four of his teeth were drawn out, and that he confessed
himself guilty to save the remainder. Others of the fraternity
deposed to the infliction on them of the most revolting
and indecent torments;<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> and, in addition to all this, it appears
that forged letters from the Grand Master were shown to the
prisoners, exhorting them to confess themselves guilty! Many
of the Templars were accordingly compelled to acknowledge
whatever was required of them, and to plead guilty to the commission
of crimes which, in the previous interrogatories, they had
positively denied.</p>

<p>These violent proceedings excited the astonishment of
Europe. On the 20th of November, the king of England summoned
the seneschal of Agen to his presence, and examined
him concerning the truth of the horrible charges preferred
against the Templars; and on the 4th of December, the
English monarch wrote letters to the kings of Portugal, Castile,
Aragon, and Sicily, to the following effect:&mdash;“To the magnificent
prince the Lord Dionysius, by the grace of God the illustrious
king of Portugal, his very dear friend, Edward, by the
same grace king of England, &amp;c. Health and prosperity. It is
fit and proper, inasmuch as it conduceth to the honour of God
and the exaltation of the faith, that we should prosecute with
benevolence those who come recommended to us by strenuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
labours and incessant exertions in defence of the Catholic faith,
and for the destruction of the enemies of the cross of Christ.
Verily, a certain clerk (Bernard Peletin,) drawing nigh unto our
presence, applied himself, with all his might, to the destruction
of the order of the brethren of the Temple of Jerusalem. He
dared to publish before us and our council certain horrible and
detestable enormities repugnant to the Catholic faith, to the
prejudice of the aforesaid brothers, endeavouring to persuade
us, through his own allegations, as well as through certain
letters which he had caused to be addressed to us for that purpose,
that by reason of the premises, and without a due examination
of the matter, we ought to imprison all the brethren of the
aforesaid order abiding in our dominions. But, considering
that the order, which hath been renowned for its religion and
its honour, and in times long since passed away was instituted,
as we have learned, by the Catholic Fathers, exhibits, and hath
from the period of its first foundation exhibited, a becoming
devotion to God and his holy church, and also, up to this time,
hath afforded succour and protection to the Catholic faith in
parts beyond sea, it appeared to us that a ready belief in an
accusation of this kind, hitherto altogether unheard of against
the fraternity, was scarcely to be expected. We affectionately
ask, and require of your royal majesty, that ye, with due diligence,
consider of the premises, and turn a deaf ear to the
slanders of ill-natured men, who are animated, as we believe,
not with a zeal of rectitude, but with a spirit of <i>cupidity</i> and
envy, permitting no injury unadvisedly to be done to the persons
or property of the brethren of the aforesaid order, dwelling
within your kingdom, until they have been legally convicted of
the crimes laid to their charge, or it shall happen to be otherwise
ordered concerning them in these parts.”</p>

<p>A few days after the transmission of this letter, king Edward
wrote to the pope, expressing his disbelief of the horrible and
detestable rumours spread abroad concerning the Templars.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
He represents them to his holiness as universally respected by
all men in his dominions for the purity of their faith and
morals. He expresses great sympathy for the affliction and
distress suffered by the Master and brethren, by reason of the
scandal circulated concerning them; and he strongly urges the
holy pontiff to clear, by some fair course of inquiry, the character
of the order from the unjust and infamous aspersions cast
against it.<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> On the 22nd of November, however, a fortnight
previously, the pope had issued the following bull to king
Edward. “Clement, bishop, servant of the servants of God, to
his very dear son in Christ, Edward, the illustrious king of England,
health and apostolical blessing.</p>

<p>“Presiding, though unworthy, on the throne of pastoral pre-eminence,
by the disposition of him who disposeth all things,
we fervently seek after this one thing above all others; we with
ardent wishes aspire to this, that shaking off the sleep of
negligence, whilst watching over the Lord’s flock, by removing
that which is hurtful, and taking care of such things as are
profitable, we may be able, by the divine assistance, to bring
souls to God. In truth, a long time ago, about the period of
our first promotion to the summit of the apostolical dignity,
there came to our ears a light rumour to the effect that the
Templars, though fighting ostensibly under the guise of religion,
have hitherto been secretly living in perfidious apostasy,
and in detestable heretical depravity. But, considering that
their order, in times long since passed away, shone forth with
the grace of much nobility and honour, and that they were for
a length of time held in vast reverence by the faithful, and that
we had then heard of no suspicion concerning the premises, or
of evil report against them; and also, that from the beginning
of their religion, they have publicly borne the cross of Christ,
exposing their bodies and goods against the enemies of the
faith, for the acquisition, retention, and defence of the Holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
Land, consecrated by the precious blood of our Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ, we were unwilling to yield a ready belief to
the accusation....”</p>

<p>The holy pontiff then states, that afterwards, however, the
same dreadful intelligence was conveyed to the king of France,
who, animated by a lively zeal in the cause of religion, took immediate
steps to ascertain its truth. He describes the various
confessions of the guilt of idolatry and heresy made by the Templars
in France, and requires the king forthwith to cause all the
Templars in his dominions to be taken into custody on the
same day. He directs him to hold them, in the name of the
pope, at the disposition of the Holy See, and to commit all their
real and personal property to the hands of certain trustworthy
persons, to be faithfully preserved until the holy pontiff shall
give further directions concerning it. King Edward received
this bull immediately after he had despatched his letter to the
pope, exhorting his holiness not to give ear to the accusations
against the order. The young king was now either convinced of
the guilt of the Templars, on the high authority of the sovereign
pontiff, or hoped to turn the proceedings against them to a
profitable account, as he yielded a ready and prompt compliance
with the pontifical commands. An order in council was made
for the arrest of the Templars, and the seizure of their property.
Inventories were directed to be taken of their goods and chattels,
and provision was made for the sowing and tilling of their lands
during the period of their imprisonment.</p>

<p>On the 26th of December the king wrote to the pope, informing
his holiness that he would carry his commands into execution
in the best and speediest way that he could; and on the 8th
of January, <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1308, the Templars were suddenly arrested in
all parts of England, and their property was seized into the king’s
hands. Brother William de la More was at this period Master
of the Temple, or Preceptor of England. He succeeded the
Master Brian le Jay, who was slain, as before mentioned, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
battle of Falkirk, and was taken prisoner, together with all his
brethren of the Temple at London, and committed to close custody
in Canterbury Castle. He was afterwards liberated on bail
at the instance of the bishop of Durham.<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>On the 12th of August, the pope addressed the bull <i>faciens
misericordiam</i> to the English bishops as follows:&mdash;“Clement,
bishop, servant of the servants of God, to the venerable brethren
the archbishop of Canterbury, and his suffragans, health and
apostolical benediction. The Son of God, the Lord Jesus
Christ, using mercy with his servant, would have us taken up
into the eminent mirror of the apostleship, to this end, that
being, though unworthy, his vicar upon earth, we may, as far as
human frailty will permit in all our actions and proceedings,
follow his footsteps.” He describes the rumours which had
been spread abroad in France against the Templars, and his unwillingness
to believe them, “because it was not likely, nor did
seem credible, that such religious men, who continually shed
their blood for the name of Christ, and were thought to expose
their persons to danger of death for his sake; and who often
showed many and great signs of devotion, as well in the divine
offices as in fasting and other observances, should be so unmindful
of their salvation as to perpetrate such things; we were unwilling
to give ear to the insinuations and impeachments against
them, being taught so to do by the example of the same Lord of
ours, and the writings of canonical doctrine. But afterwards,
our most dear son in Christ, Philip, the illustrious king of the
French, to whom the same crimes had been made known, <i>not
from motives of avarice</i>, (since he does not design to apply or to
appropriate to himself any portion of the estates of the Templars,
nay, has washed his hands of them!) but inflamed with
zeal for the orthodox faith, following the renowned footsteps of
his ancestors, getting what information he properly could upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
the premises, gave us much instruction in the matter by his
messengers and letters.” The holy pontiff then gives a long
account of the various confessions made in France, and of the
absolution granted to such of the Templars as were truly contrite
and penitent; he expresses his conviction of the guilt of
the order, and makes provision for the trial of the fraternity in
England. King Edward in the mean time, had begun to make
free with their property, and the pope, on the 4th of October,
wrote to him to the following effect:</p>

<p>“Your conduct begins again to afford us no slight cause of
affliction, inasmuch as it hath been brought to our knowledge
from the report of several barons, that in contempt of the Holy
See, and without fear of offending the divine Majesty, you have,
of your own sole authority, distributed to different persons the
property which belonged formerly to the order of the Temple in
your dominions, which you had got into your hands at our command,
and which ought to have remained at our disposition....
We have therefore ordained that certain fit and proper persons
shall be sent into your kingdom, and to all parts of the world
where the Templars are known to have had property, to take
possession of the same conjointly with certain prelates specially
deputed to that end, and to make an inquisition concerning the
execrable excesses which the members of the order are said to
have committed.”<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> To this letter of the supreme pontiff, king
Edward sent the following short and pithy reply:&mdash;“As to the
goods of the Templars, we have done nothing with them up to
the present time, nor do we intend to do with them aught but
what we have a right to do, and what we know will be acceptable
to the Most High.”</p>

<p>On the 13th of September, <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1309, the king granted letters
of safe conduct “to those discreet men, the abbot of Lagny, in
the diocese of Paris, and Master Sicard de Vaur, canon of Narbonne,”
the inquisitors appointed by the pope to examine the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
Grand Preceptor and brethren of the Temple in England; and
the same day he wrote to the archbishop of Canterbury, and the
bishops of London and Lincoln, enjoining them to be personally
present with the papal inquisitors, at their respective sees, as
often as such inquisitors, or any one of them, should proceed
with their inquiries against the Templars.<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>Among the prisoners confined in the Tower were Brother
William de la More, Knight, Grand Preceptor of England, otherwise
Master of the Temple; Brother Himbert Blanke, Knight,
Grand Preceptor of Auvergne, one of the veteran warriors who
had fought to the last in defence of Palestine, had escaped the
slaughter at Acre, and had accompanied the Grand Master from
Cyprus to France, whence he crossed over to England, and was
rewarded for his meritorious and memorable services, in defence
of the christian faith, with a dungeon in the Tower. Brother
<i>Radulph de Barton</i>, priest of the order of the Temple, custos or
guardian of the Temple church, and prior of London; Brother
<i>Michael de Baskeville</i>, Knight, Preceptor of London; Brother
<i>John de Stoke</i>, Knight, Treasurer of the Temple at London;
together with many other knights and serving brethren of
the same house. There were also in custody in the Tower the
Knights Preceptors of the preceptories of Ewell in Kent, of
Daney and Dokesworth in Cambridgeshire, of Getinges in
Gloucestershire, of Cumbe in Somersetshire, of Schepeley in
Surrey, of Samford and Bistelesham in Oxfordshire, of Garwy in
Herefordshire, of Cressing in Essex, of Pafflet, Huppleden, and
other preceptories, together with several priests and chaplains of
the order. A general scramble appears to have taken place for
possession of the goods and chattels of the imprisoned Templars;
and the king, to check the robberies that were committed,
appointed Alan de Goldyngham and John de Medefeld to inquire
into the value of the property that had been carried off,
and to inform him of the names of the parties who had obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
possession of it. The sheriffs of the different counties were also
directed to summon juries, through whom the truth might he
better obtained.<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>On the 22nd of September, the archbishop of Canterbury,
acting in obedience to the papal commands, before a single witness
had been examined in England, caused to be published in
all churches and chapels a papal bull, wherein the pope declares
himself perfectly convinced of the guilt of the order, and solemnly
denounces the penalty of excommunication against all
persons, of whatever rank, station, or condition in life, whether
clergy or laity, who should knowingly afford, either publicly or
privately, assistance, counsel, or kindness to the Templars, or
should dare to shelter them, or give them countenance or protection,
and also laying under interdict all cities, castles, lands
and places, which should harbour any of the members of the
proscribed order! At the commencement of the month of October,
the inquisitors arrived in England, and immediately published
the bull appointing the commission, enjoining the citation
of criminals, and of witnesses, and denouncing the heaviest
ecclesiastical censures against the disobedient, and against every
person who should dare to impede the inquisitors in the exercise
of their functions. Citations were made in St. Paul’s Cathedral,
and in all the churches of the ecclesiastical province of Canterbury,
at the end of high mass, requiring the Templars to appear
before the inquisitors at a certain time and place, and the articles
of accusation were transmitted to the constable of the
Tower, in Latin, French, and English, to be read to all the Templars
imprisoned in that fortress.</p>

<p>On Monday, the 20th of October, after the Templars had been
languishing in the English prisons for more than a year and
eight months, the tribunal constituted by the pope to take the
inquisition in the province of Canterbury assembled in the episcopal
hall of London. It was composed of the bishop of London<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
Dieudonné, abbot of the monastery of Lagny, in the diocese of
Paris, and Sicard de Vaur, canon of Narbonne, the pope’s chaplain,
and hearer of causes in the pontifical palace. They were
assisted by several foreign notaries. After the reading of the
papal bulls, and some preliminary proceedings, the articles of
accusation, a monument of human folly, superstition, and credulity,
were solemnly exhibited. It was urged against the Templars:
“1. That at their first reception into the order, or at
some time afterwards, or as soon as an opportunity occurred,
they were induced or admonished by those who had received
them within the bosom of the fraternity, to deny Christ or Jesus,
or the crucifixion, or at one time God, and at another time the
blessed Virgin, and sometimes all the saints.&mdash;5. That the receivers
told and instructed those that were received, that Christ
was not the true God, or sometimes Jesus, or sometimes the
person crucified.&mdash;7. That they said he had not suffered for
the redemption of mankind, nor been crucified but for his own
sins.&mdash;9. That they made those they received into the order spit
upon the cross, or upon the sign or figure of the cross, or the
image of Christ.&mdash;10. That they caused the cross itself to be
trampled under foot.&mdash;11. That the brethren themselves did
sometimes trample on the same cross.&mdash;12. Item quod mingebant
interdum, et alios mingere faciebant, super ipsam crucem.&mdash;14.
That they worshipped a cat, which was placed in the
midst of the congregation.&mdash;16. That they did not believe the
sacrament of the altar nor the other sacraments of the church.&mdash;24.
That they believed, and so it was told them, that the Grand
Master of the order could absolve them from their sins.&mdash;25.
That the visitor could do so.&mdash;26. That the preceptors, of
whom many were laymen, could do it.&mdash;36. That the receptions
of the brethren were made clandestinely.&mdash;37. That none were
present but the brothers of the said order.&mdash;38. That for this
reason there has for a long time been a vehement suspicion
against them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>The succeeding articles charge the Templars with crimes and
abominations too horrible and disgusting to be named.</p>

<p>“46. That the brothers themselves had idols in every province,
viz. heads; some of which had three faces, and some one,
and some a man’s skull.&mdash;47. That they adored that idol, or
those idols, especially in their great chapters and assemblies&mdash;48.
That they worshipped them.&mdash;49. As their God.&mdash;50. As
their Saviour.&mdash;51. That some of them did so.&mdash;52. That the
greater part did.&mdash;53. They said that those heads could save
them.&mdash;54. That they could produce riches.&mdash;55. That they
had given to the order all its wealth.&mdash;56. That they caused
the earth to bring forth seed.&mdash;57. That they made the trees to
nourish.&mdash;58. That they bound or touched the heads of the said
idols with cords, wherewith they bound themselves about their
shirts, or next their skins.&mdash;59. That at their reception the
aforesaid little cords, or others of the same length, were delivered
to each of the brothers.&mdash;60. That they did this in worship
of their idols.&mdash;61. That it was enjoined them to gird
themselves with the said little cords, as before mentioned, and
continually to wear them.&mdash;62. That the brethren of the order
were generally received in that manner.&mdash;63. That they did
these things out of devotion.&mdash;64. That they did them everywhere.&mdash;65.
That the greater part did.&mdash;66. That those who
refused the things above mentioned at their reception, or to
observe them afterwards, were killed or cast into prison.”<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> The
remaining articles, twenty-one in number, are directed principally
to the mode of confession practised amongst the fraternity,
and to matters of heretical depravity.&mdash;Such an accusation as
this, justly remarks Voltaire, <i>destroys itself</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>Brother William de la More, and thirty more of his brethren,
being interrogated before the inquisitors, positively denied the
guilt of the order, and affirmed that the Templars who had
made the confession alluded to in France <i>had lied</i>. They were
ordered to be brought up separately to be examined. On the
23rd of October, Brother William Raven, being interrogated as
to the mode of his reception into the order, states that he was
admitted by Brother William de la More, the Master of the
Temple at Temple Coumbe, in the diocese of Bath; that he
petitioned the brethren of the Temple that they would be
pleased to receive him into the order to serve God and the
blessed Virgin Mary, and to end his life in their service; that
he was asked if he had a firm wish so to do; and replied that
he had; that two brothers then expounded to him the strictness
and severity of the order, and told him that he would not be
allowed to act after his own will, but must follow the will of the
preceptor; that if he wished to do one thing, he would be ordered
to do another; and that if he wished to be at one place,
he would be sent to another; that having promised so to act,
he swore upon the holy gospels of God to obey the Master, to
hold no property, to preserve chastity, never to consent that any
man should be unjustly despoiled of his heritage, and never to
lay violent hands on any man, except in self-defence, or upon
the Saracens. He states that the oath was administered to him
in the chapel of the preceptory of Temple Coumbe, in the presence
only of the brethren of the order; that the rule was read
over to him by one of the brothers, and that a learned serving
brother, named John de Walpole, instructed him, for the space
of one month, upon the matters contained in it. The prisoner
was then taken back to the Tower, and was directed to be strictly
separated from his brethren, and not to be suffered to speak to
any one of them.</p>

<p>The next two days (October 24th and 25th) were taken up
with a similar examination of Brothers Hugh de Tadecastre and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
Thomas le Chamberleyn, who gave precisely the same account
of their reception as the previous witness. Brother Hugh de
Tadecastre added, that he swore to succour the Holy Land with
all his might, and defend it against the enemies of the christian
faith; and that after he had taken the customary oaths and the
three vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience, the mantle of the
order with the cross and the coif were delivered to him in the
church, in the presence of the Master, the knights, and the
brothers, all seculars being excluded. Brother Thomas le
Chamberleyn added, that there was the same mode of reception
in England as beyond sea, and the same mode of taking the
vows; that all seculars were excluded, and that when he himself
entered the Temple church to be professed, the door by which
he entered was closed after him; that there was another door
looking into the cemetery, but that no stranger could enter that
way. On being asked why none but the brethren of the order
were permitted to be present at the reception and profession of
brothers, he said he knew of no reason, but that it was so written
in their book of rules.</p>

<p>Between the 25th of October and the 17th of November,
thirty-three knights, chaplains, and serving brothers, were examined,
all of whom positively denied every article imputing
crime or infidelity to their order. When Brother Himbert
Blanke was asked why they had made the reception and profession
of brethren secret, he replied, “through our own unaccountable
folly.” They avowed that they wore little cords
round their shirts, but for no bad end; they declared that
they never touched idols with them, but that they were worn
by way of penance, or according to a knight of forty-three
years standing, by the instruction of the holy father St. Bernard.
Brother Richard de Goldyngham says that he knows
nothing further about them than that they were called girdles
of chastity. They state that the receivers and the party
received kissed one another on the face, but everything else<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
regarding the kissing was false, abominable, and had never been
done.</p>

<p>Radulph de Barton, priest of the order of the Temple, and
custos or guardian of the Temple church at London, stated,
with regard to Article 24, that the Grand Master in chapter
could absolve the brothers from offences committed against the
rules and observances of the order, but not from private sin,
as he was not a priest; that it was perfectly true that those
who were received into the order swore not to reveal the secrets
of the chapter, and that when any one was punished in the
chapter, those who were present at it durst not reveal it to such
as were absent; but if any brother revealed the mode of his
reception, he would be deprived of his chamber, or else stripped
of his habit. He declares that the brethren were not prohibited
from confessing to priests not belonging to the order of
the Temple; and that he had never heard of the crimes and
iniquities mentioned in the articles of inquiry previous to his
arrest, except as regarded the charges made against the order by
Bernard Peletin, when he came to England from king Philip of
France. He states that he had been custos of the Temple
church at London for ten years, and for the last two years had
enjoyed the dignity of preceptor at the same place. He was
asked about the death of Brother Walter le Bachelor, knight,
formerly Preceptor of Ireland, who died in the Temple at
London, but he declares that he knows nothing about it, except
that the said Walter was fettered and placed in prison, and
there died; that he certainly had heard that great severity had
been practised towards him, but that he had not meddled with
the affair on account of the danger of so doing; he admitted
also that the aforesaid Walter was not buried in the cemetery
of the Temple, as he was considered excommunicated on account
of his disobedience of his superior, and of the rule of the
order.</p>

<p>Many of the brethren thus examined had been from twenty to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
thirty, forty, forty-two, and forty-three years in the order, and
some were old veteran warriors who had fought for many a
long year in the thirsty plains of Palestine. Brother Himbert
Blanke, Knight, Preceptor of Auvergne, had been in the order
thirty-eight years. He was received at the city of Tyre, had
been engaged in constant warfare against the infidels, and had
fought to the last in defence of Acre. Brother Robert le Scott,
Knight, a brother of twenty-six years’ standing, had been received
at the Pilgrim’s Castle, the famous fortress of the Knights
Templars in Palestine, by the Grand Master, Brother William
de Beaujeu, the hero who died so gloriously at the head of his
knights at the last siege and storming of Acre. He states that
from levity of disposition he quitted the order after it had been
driven out of Palestine, and absented himself for two years,
during which period he came to Rome, and confessed to the
pope’s penitentiary, who imposed on him a heavy penance, and
enjoined him to return to his brethren in the East, and that he
went back and resumed his habit at Nicosia in the island of
Cyprus, and was re-admitted to the order by command of the
Grand Master, James de Molay. He adds, also, that Brother
Himbert Blanke (the previous witness) was present at his first
reception at the Pilgrim’s Castle.</p>

<p>On the 22nd day of the inquiry, the following entry was made
on the record of the proceedings:&mdash;“Memorandum. Brothers
Philip de Mewes, Thomas de Burton, and Thomas de Staundon,
were advised and earnestly exhorted to abandon their religious
profession, who severally replied that they would rather die than
do so.” On the 19th and 20th of November, seven lay witnesses,
unconnected with the order, were examined before the inquisitors
in the chapel of the monastery of the Holy Trinity. Master
William le Dorturer, notary public, declared that the Templars
rose at midnight, and held their chapters before dawn, and he
<i>thought</i> that the mystery and secrecy of the receptions were
owing to a bad rather than a good motive, but declared that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
had never observed that they had acquired, or had attempted to
acquire, anything unjustly. Master Gilbert de Bruere, clerk,
said that he had never suspected them of anything worse
than an excessive correction of the brethren. William Lambert,
formerly a “messenger of the Temple,” knew nothing
bad of the Templars, and thought them perfectly innocent of all
the matters alluded to. And Richard de Barton, priest, and Radulph
de Rayndon, an old man, both declared that they knew
nothing of the order, or of the members of it, but what was good
and honourable.</p>

<p>On the 25th of November, a provincial council of the church,
composed of the bishops, abbots, priors, heads of colleges, and
all the principal clergy, assembled in St. Paul’s Cathedral, and a
papal bull was read, in which the holy pontiff dwells most
pathetically upon the awful sins of the Templars, and their
great and tremendous fall from their previous high estate.
Hitherto, says he, they have been renowned throughout the
world as the special champions of the faith, and the chief defenders
of the Holy Land, whose affairs have been mainly regulated
by those brothers. The church, following them and their
order with the plenitude of its especial favour and regard, armed
them with the emblem of the cross against the enemies of
Christ, exalted them with much honour, enriched them with
wealth, and fortified them with various liberties and privileges.
The holy pontiff displays the sad report of their sins and iniquities
which reached his ears, filled him with bitterness and grief,
disturbed his repose, smote him with horror, injured his health,
and caused his body to waste away! He gives a long account
of the crimes imputed to the order, of the confessions and depositions
that had been made in France, and then bursts out into a
paroxysm of grief, declares that the melancholy affair deeply
moved all the faithful, that all Christianity was shedding bitter
tears, was overwhelmed with grief, and clothed with mourning.
He concludes by decreeing the assembly of a general council of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
the church at Vienne to pronounce the abolition of the order,
and to determine on the disposal of its property, to which council
the English clergy are required to send representatives.</p>

<p>In Scotland, in the mean time, similar proceedings had been
instituted against the order. On the 17th of November, Brother
Walter de Clifton being examined in the parish church of the
Holy Cross at Edinburgh, before the bishop of St. Andrews and
John de Solerio, the pope’s chaplain, states that the brethren of
the order of the Temple in the kingdom of Scotland received
their orders, rules, and observances from the Master of the
Temple in England, and that the Master in England received
the rules and observances of the order from the Grand
Master and the chief convent in the East; that the Grand
Master or his deputy was in the habit of visiting the order in
England and elsewhere; of summoning chapters and making
regulations for the conduct of the brethren, and the administration
of their property. Being asked as to the mode of his reception,
he states that when William de la More, the Master, held
his chapter at the preceptory of Temple Bruere in the county of
Lincoln, he sought of the assembled brethren the habit and the
fellowship of the order; that they told him that he little knew
what it was he asked, in seeking to be admitted to their fellowship;
that it would be a very hard matter for him, who was then
his own master, to become the servant of another, and to have
no will of his own; but notwithstanding their representations of
the rigour of their rules and observances, he still continued
earnestly to seek their habit and fellowship. He states that they
then led him to the chamber of the Master, where they held
their chapter, and that there, on his bended knees, and with his
hands clasped, he again prayed for the habit and the fellowship
of the Temple; that the Master and the brethren then required
him to answer questions to the following effect:&mdash;Whether he
had a dispute with any man, or owed any debts? whether he
was betrothed to any woman? and whether he had any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
secret infirmity of body? or knew of anything to prevent him
from remaining within the bosom of the fraternity? And
having answered all these questions satisfactorily, the Master
then asked of the surrounding brethren, “Do ye give your
consent to the reception of Brother Walter?” who unanimously
answered that they did; and the Master and the
brethren then standing up, received him the said Walter in this
manner. On his bended knees, and with his hands joined, he
solemnly promised that he would be the perpetual servant of
the Master, and of the order, and of the brethren, for the purpose
of defending the Holy Land. Having done this, the
Master took out of the hands of a brother chaplain of the order
the book of the holy gospels, upon which was depicted a cross,
and laying his hand upon the book, and upon the cross, he
swore to God and the blessed Virgin Mary to be for ever thereafter
chaste, obedient, and to live without property. And then
the Master gave to him the white mantle, and placed the coif
on his head and admitted him to the kiss on the mouth, after
which he made him sit down on the ground, and admonished
him to the following effect: that from thenceforth he was to
sleep in his shirt, drawers, and stockings, girded with a small
cord over his shirt; that he was never to tarry in a house where
there was a woman in the family way; never to be present at a
marriage or at the purification of women; and likewise instructed
and informed him upon several other particulars.
Being asked where he had passed his time since his reception,
he replied that he had dwelt three years at the preceptory of
Blancradok in Scotland; three years at Temple Newsom in
England; one year at the Temple at London, and three years
at Aslakeby. Being asked concerning the other brothers in
Scotland, he stated that John de Hueflete was Preceptor of
Blancradok, the chief house of the order in that country, and
that he and the other brethren, having heard of the arrest of the
Templars, threw off their habits, and fled, and that he had not
since heard aught concerning them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p>Forty-one witnesses, chiefly abbots, priors, monks, priests,
and serving men, and retainers of the order in Scotland, were
examined upon various interrogatories, but nothing of a criminatory
nature was elicited. The monks observed that the receptions
of other orders were public, and were celebrated as
great religious solemnities, and the friends, parents, and neighbours
of the party about to take the vows were invited to attend;
while the Templars, on the other hand, shrouded their proceedings
in mystery and secrecy, and therefore they <i>suspected</i> the
worst. The priests thought them guilty, because they were
always against the church! Others condemned them because
(as they say) the Templars closed their doors against the poor
and the humble, and extended hospitality only to the rich and
the powerful. The abbot of the monastery of the Holy Cross
at Edinburgh declared that they appropriated to themselves the
property of their neighbours, right or wrong. The abbot of
Dumferlyn knew nothing of his own knowledge against them,
but had <i>heard</i> much, and <i>suspected</i> more. The serving men and
the tillers of the lands of the order stated that the chapters were
held sometimes by night and sometimes by day, with extraordinary
secrecy; and some of the witnesses had heard old men say
that the Templars would never have lost the Holy Land if they
had been good Christians!</p>

<p>On the 9th of January, <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1310, the examination of witnesses
was resumed at London, in the parish church of St.
Dunstan’s West, near the Temple. The rector of the church of
St. Mary de la Strode declared that he had strong <i>suspicions</i> of
the guilt of the Templars; he had, however, often been at the
Temple church, and had observed that the priests performed
divine service there just the same as elsewhere. William de
Cumbrook, of St. Clement’s church, near the Temple, the vicar
of St. Martin’s-in-the-Fields, and many other priests and clergymen
of different churches in London, all declared that they had
nothing to allege against the order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 27th of January, Brother John de Stoke, a serving
brother of the order of the Temple, of seventeen years’ standing,
being examined by the inquisitors in the chapel of the Blessed
Mary of Berkyngecherche at London, states, amongst other
things, that secular persons were allowed to be present at the
burial of Templars; that the brethren of the order all received
the sacraments of the church at their last hour, and were
attended to the grave by a chaplain of the Temple. Being interrogated
concerning the burial of the Knight Templar Brother
Walter le Bacheler, Grand Preceptor of Ireland, who had been
confined in the penitential cell in the Temple, for disobedience
to his superiors, and was reported to have been there starved to
death, he deposes that the said knight was buried like any other
Christian, except that he was not buried in the burying-ground,
but in the court of the house of the Temple at London; that he
confessed to Brother Richard de Grafton, a priest of the order,
then in the island of Cyprus, and partook, as he believed, of the
sacrament. He states that he himself and Brother Radulph de
Barton carried him to his grave at the dawn of day, and that the
deceased knight was in prison, as he believes, for the space of
eight weeks; that he was not buried in the habit of his order,
and was interred without the cemetery of the brethren, because
he was considered to be excommunicated, in pursuance, as he
believed, of a rule or statute among the Templars, to the effect
that every one who privily made away with the property of the
order, and did not acknowledge his fault, was deemed excommunicated.</p>

<p>On the 30th of March, the papal inquisitors opened their commission
at Lincoln, and numerous Templars were examined in
the chapter-house of the cathedral, amongst whom were some of
the veteran warriors of Palestine, who had moistened with their
blood the distant plains of the far East. Brother William de
Winchester, a member of twenty-six years’ standing, stated that
he had been received into the order at the castle <i>de la Roca<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
Guille</i>, in the province of Armenia, bordering on Syria, by the
valiant Grand Master William de Beaujeu. He states that the
same mode of reception existed there as in England, and everywhere
throughout the order. Brother Robert de Hamilton declares
that the girdles said to be worn by the brethren were
called girdles of Nazareth, because they had been pressed against
the column of the Virgin at that place, and were worn in remembrance
of the blessed Mary.</p>

<p>At York, the examination commenced on the 28th of April,
and lasted until the 4th of May, during which period twenty-three
Templars, prisoners in York Castle, were examined in the
chapter-house of the cathedral, and followed the example of
their brethren in maintaining their innocence. Brother Thomas
de Stanford, a member of thirty years’ standing, had been received
in the East by the Grand Master William de Beaujeu,
and Brother Radulph de Rostona, a priest of the order, of
twenty-three years’ standing, had been received at the preceptory
of Lentini in Sicily, by Brother William de Canello, the Grand
Preceptor of Sicily. Brother Stephen de Radenhall refused to
reveal the mode of reception, because it formed part of the
secrets of the chapter, and if he discovered them he would lose
his chamber, be stripped of his mantle, or be committed to
prison.<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>The proceedings against the order in France had, in the
mean time, assumed a most sanguinary character. On the 28th
of March, (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1310) five hundred and forty-six Templars, who
persisted in maintaining the innocence of their order, were
assembled in the garden of the bishop’s palace at Paris, to hear
the articles of accusation read over to them, and a committee of
their number was authorised to draw up a written defence.
They asked to have an interview with the Grand Master and
the heads of the order, but this was refused. The total number
of Templars, immured in the prisons of Paris, was nine hundred.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
In the course of the examination before the papal commissioners,
Brother Laurent de Beaume produced a letter which
had been sent to him and his fellow-prisoners at Sens, warning
them against a retractation of their confessions in the following
terms: “<i>Sachez que notre pere le pape a mande que tuit cil qui
aurent fayt les suizitos confessions devant ses anvouez, qui en cele
confessions ne voudroient perseverès, que il sorent mis a damnazion et
destruit au feu.</i>” This threat was carried into execution, and
Brother Laurent de Beaume was one of the first victims. The
defence drawn up by the brethren and presented to the commissioners
by Brother Peter de Bologna, begins by stating the
origin and objects of their institution, the vows to which they
subjected themselves, and the mode in which persons were received
into the fraternity. They give a frightful account of the
tortures that had been inflicted upon them, and declare that
those who had escaped with life from the hands of the tormentors,
were either ruined in health or injured in intellect,
and that as pardon and forgiveness had been freely offered to
those knights who would confess, it was not wonderful that false
confessions had been made. They observed that a vast number
of knights had died in prison, and they exhorted the commissioners
to interrogate the guards, jailers, and executioners, and
those who saw them in their last moments, concerning the declarations
and confessions they had made at the peril of their
souls when dying. They maintained that it was a most extraordinary
thing that so many knights of distinguished birth and
noble blood, members of the most illustrious families in Europe,
should have remained from an early age up to the day of their
death, members of the order, and should never, in days of sickness,
or at the hour of death, have revealed any of the horrid
iniquities and abominations charged against it.<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> All the Templars,
indeed, who had made confessions were rapidly following
one another’s example in retracting them, and maintaining their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
innocence, and the king hastened to arrest the unfavourable
march of events.</p>

<p>The archbishop of Sens, whose ecclesiastical authority extended
over the diocese of Paris, having died, the king obtained
the vacant see for Philip de Martigny, a creature of his own,
who was installed therein in the month of April. In a letter to
Clement urging this appointment, Philip reminds the holy
pontiff that the new archbishop would have to preside over a
provincial council wherein would be transacted many things
which immediately concerned the glory of God, the stability of
the faith, and of the holy church. Immediately after the enthronement
of this new archbishop, the provincial council of
Sens was convoked at Paris, and on the 10th of May, all the
Templars who had revoked their confessions, and had come
forward to maintain the innocence of their order, were dragged
before it, and sentence of death was passed upon them by the
archbishop in the following terms:&mdash;“You have avowed,” said
he, “that the brethren who are received into the order of the
Temple are compelled to renounce Christ and spit upon the
cross, and that you yourselves have participated in that crime;
you have thus acknowledged that you have fallen into the sin
of <i>heresy</i>. By your confession and repentance you had merited
absolution, and had once more become reconciled to the church.
As you have revoked your confession, the church no longer regards
you as reconciled, but as having fallen back to your first
errors. You are, therefore, <i>relapsed heretics</i>, and as such, we
condemn you to the fire!” As soon as the commissioners had
received intelligence of this extraordinary decree, they despatched
messengers to the archbishop and his suffragans, praying them
to delay the execution of their sentence, as very many persons
affirmed that the Templars who died in prison had proclaimed
with their last breath the innocence of their order. But these
representations were of no avail. The archbishop, who was paying
the price of his elevation to a hard creditor, proceeded to
make short work of the business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>

<p>The very next morning, (Tuesday, May 12,) fifty-four Templars
were handed over to the secular arm, and were led out to
execution by the king’s officers. They were conducted, at daybreak,
into the open country, in the environs of the Porte St.
Antoine des Champs at Paris, and were there fastened to stakes
driven into the ground, and surrounded by faggots and charcoal.
In this situation, they saw the torches lighted, and the
executioners approaching to accomplish their task, and they
were once more offered pardon and favour if they would confess
the <i>guilt</i> of their order; they persisted in the maintenance of
its <i>innocence</i>, and were burnt to death in a most cruel manner
before slow fires! All historians speak with admiration of the
heroism and intrepidity with which they met their fate. Many
hundred other Templars were dragged from the dungeons of
Paris before the archbishop of Sens and his council. Those
whom neither the agony of torture nor the fear of death could
overcome, but who remained stedfast amid all their trials in
the maintenance of their innocence, were condemned to perpetual
imprisonment as <i>unreconciled heretics</i>; whilst those who,
having made the required confessions of guilt, continued to persevere
in them, received absolution, were declared reconciled to
the church, and were set at liberty.<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>On the 18th of August, four other Templars were condemned
as relapsed heretics by the council of Sens, and were likewise
burnt by the Porte St. Antoine; and it is stated that a hundred
and thirteen Templars were, from first to last, burnt at the stake
in Paris. Many others were burned in Lorraine; in Normandy;
at Carcassone; and nine, or, according to some writers,
twenty-nine, were burnt by the archbishop of Rheims at Senlis!
King Philip’s officers, indeed, not content with their inhuman
cruelty towards the living, invaded the sanctity of the tomb;
they dragged a dead Templar, who had been treasurer of the<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">93.</span><br />
Temple at Paris, from his grave, and burnt the mouldering
corpse as a heretic. In the midst of all these sanguinary atrocities,
the examinations continued before the ecclesiastical tribunals.
Many aged and illustrious warriors, who merited a
better fate, appeared before their judges pale and trembling. At
first they revoked their confessions, declared their innocence,
and were remanded to prison; and then, panic-stricken, they
demanded to be led back before the papal commissioners, when
they abandoned their retractations, persisted in their previous
avowals of <i>guilt</i>, humbly expressed their sorrow and repentance,
and were then pardoned, absolved, and reconciled to the church!
The torture still continued to be applied, and out of thirty-three
Templars confined in the chateau d’Alaix, four died in
prison, and the remaining twenty confessed, amongst other things,
the following absurdities:&mdash;that in the provincial chapter of the
order held at Montpelier, the Templars set up a head and worshipped
it; that the devil often appeared there in the shape of
a cat, and conversed with the assembled brethren, and promised
them a good harvest, with the possession of riches, and all
kinds of temporal property. Some asserted that the head worshipped
by the fraternity possessed a long beard; others that
it was a woman’s head; and one of the prisoners declared that
as often as this wonderful head was adored, a great number
of devils made their appearance in the shape of beautiful
women...!!</p>

<p>We must now unfold the dark page in the history of the order
in England. All the Templars in custody in this country had
been examined separately, and had, notwithstanding, deposed in
substance to the same effect, and given the same account of their
reception into the order, and of the oaths that they took. Any
reasonable and impartial mind would consequently have been
satisfied of the truth of their statements; but it was not the object
of the inquisitors to obtain evidence of the <i>innocence</i>, but
proof of the <i>guilt</i> of the order. At first, king Edward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
Second, to his honour, forbade the infliction of torture upon the
illustrious members of the Temple in his dominions&mdash;men who
had fought and bled for Christendom, and of whose piety and
morals he had a short time before given such ample testimony
to the principal sovereigns of Europe. But the virtuous resolution
of the weak king was speedily overcome by the all-powerful
influence of the Roman pontiff, who wrote to him in the month
of June, upbraiding him for preventing the inquisitors from submitting
the Templars to the discipline of the rack. Influenced
by the admonitions of the pope, and the solicitations of the
clergy, king Edward sent orders to the constable of the Tower,
to deliver up the Templars to certain gaolers appointed by the
inquisitors, in order that the inquisitors might do with the
bodies of the Templars whatever should seem fitting, in accordance
with ecclesiastical law. The ecclesiastical council then
assembled, and ordered that the Templars should be again confined
in separate cells; that fresh interrogatories should be prepared,
to see if by such means the <i>truth</i> could be extracted, and
if by straitenings and confinement they would <i>confess nothing
further</i>, then the torture was to be applied; but it was provided
that the examination by torture should be conducted without
the <span class="small">PERPETUAL MUTILATION OR DISABLING OF ANY LIMB, AND
WITHOUT A VIOLENT EFFUSION OF BLOOD</span>! and the inquisitors and
the bishops of London and Chichester were to notify the result
to the archbishop of Canterbury, that he might again convene
the assembly for the purpose of passing sentence, either of absolution
or of condemnation.</p>

<p>Fresh instructions were then sent by the king to the constable
of the Tower, and the sheriffs of London, informing them that
the king, on account of his respect for the holy apostolical see,
had conceded to the inquisitors the power of examining the
Templars by <span class="small">TORTURE</span>; and strictly enjoining them to deliver
up the Templars to the inquisitors, and receive them back when
required so to do. The king then acquainted the mayor, alder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>men,
and commonalty of his faithful city of London, that out of
reverence to the pope he had authorised the inquisitors, sent
over by his holiness, to question the Templars by <span class="small">TORTURE</span>; and
he commands them, in case it should be notified to them by the
inquisitors that the prisons provided by the sheriffs were insufficient
for their purposes, to procure without fail fit and convenient
houses in the city, or near thereto, for carrying into effect
the contemplated measures. Shortly afterwards, he again wrote
to the mayor, aldermen, and commonalty of London, acquainting
them that the sheriffs had made a return to his writ, to the
effect that the four gates (prisons) of the city were not under
their charge, and that they could not therefore obtain them for
the purposes required; and he commands the mayor, aldermen,
and commonalty, to place those four gates at the disposal of the
sheriffs. Shortly afterwards orders were given for all the Templars
in custody in London to be loaded with chains and fetters!
the myrmidons of the inquisitors were to be allowed to make
periodical visits to see that the imprisonment was properly
carried into effect, and were to be allowed to <span class="small">TORTURE</span> the bodies
of the Templars in any way that they might think fit.<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>On the 30th of March, <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1311, the examination was resumed
before the inquisitors, and the bishops of London and
Chichester, at the several churches of St. Martin’s Ludgate, and
St. Botolph’s Bishopsgate. The Templars had now been in
prison in England for the space of three years and some months.
During the whole of the previous winter they had been confined
in chains in the dungeons of the city of London, compelled to
receive their scanty supply of food from the officers of the inquisition,
and to suffer from cold, from hunger, and from torture.
They had been made to endure all the horrors of solitary confinement,
and had none to solace or to cheer them during the
long hours of their melancholy captivity. They had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
already condemned collectively by the pope, as members of an
heretical and idolatrous society, and as long as they continued to
persist in the truth of their first confessions, and in the avowal
of their innocence, they were treated as obstinate, unreconciled
heretics, living in a state of excommunication, and doomed,
when dead, to everlasting punishment in hell. They had heard
of the miserable fate of their brethren in France, and they knew
that those who had confessed crimes of which they had never
been guilty, had been immediately declared reconciled to the
church, had been absolved and set at liberty, and they knew that
freedom, pardon, and peace could be immediately purchased by
a confession of guilt; notwithstanding all which, every Templar,
at this last examination, persisted in the maintenance of his
innocence, and in the denial of all knowledge of, or participation
in, the crimes and heresies imputed to the order. They were
therefore again sent back to their dungeons, and loaded with
chains; and the inquisitors, disappointed of the desired confessions,
addressed themselves to the enemies of the order for the
necessary proofs of guilt.</p>

<p>During the month of April, seventy-two witnesses were examined
in the chapter-house of the Holy Trinity. They were
nearly all monks, Carmelites, Augustinians, Dominicans, and
Minorites; their evidence is all hearsay, and the nature of it will
be seen from the following choice specimens:&mdash;Henry Thanet,
an Irishman, had <i>heard</i> that a certain Preceptor of the Pilgrim’s
Castle was in the habit of making all the brethren he received
into the order deny Christ. He had <i>heard</i> also that a certain
Templar had in his custody a brazen head with two faces, which
would answer all questions put to it!&mdash;Master John de Nassington
had <i>heard</i> that the Templars celebrated a solemn festival
once a year, at which they worshipped a <i>calf</i>!&mdash;John de Eure,
knight, sheriff of the county of York, deposed that he had once
invited Brother William de la Fenne, Preceptor of Wesdall, to
dine with him, and that after dinner the Preceptor drew a book out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
of his bosom, and delivered it to the knight’s lady to read, who
found a piece of paper fastened into the book, on which were
written abominable heretical doctrines, to the effect that Christ
was not the Son of God, nor born of a virgin, but conceived of
the seed of Joseph, the husband of Mary, after the manner of
other men, and that Christ was not a true but a false prophet,
and was not crucified for the redemption of mankind, but for his
own sins; and many other things contrary to the christian faith.
On the production of this important evidence, Brother William
de la Fenne was called in and interrogated; he admitted that
he had dined with the sheriff of York, and had lent his lady a
book to read, but he swore that he was ignorant of the piece of
paper fastened into the book, and of its contents. It appears
that the sheriff of York had kept this discovery to himself for
the space of six years!</p>

<p>William de la Forde, a priest, rector of the parish of Crofton
in the diocese of York, had <i>heard</i> William de Reynbur, priest of
the order of St. Augustine, who was then dead, say, that the
Templar, Brother Patrick of Rippon, son of William of Gloucester,
had confessed to him, that at his entrance into the order,
he was led, clothed only in his shirt and trousers, through a
long passage to a secret chamber, and was there made to deny
his God and his Saviour; that he was then shown a representation
of the crucifixion, and was told that since he had previously
honoured that emblem he must now dishonour it and spit upon
it, and that he did so. “Item dictum fuit ei quod, depositis
brachis, dorsum verteret ad crucifixum,” and this he did bitterly
weeping. After this they brought an image, as it were, of a calf,
placed upon an altar, and they told him he must kiss that image,
and worship it, and he did so; and after all this they covered
up his eyes and led him about, kissing and being kissed by all
the brethren, but he could not recollect in what part. The
worthy priest was asked when he had <i>first heard</i> all these things,
and he replied <i>after</i> the arrest of the brethren by the king’s orders!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>Robert of Oteringham, senior of the order of Minorites, stated
that on one occasion he was partaking of the hospitality of the
Templars at the preceptory of Ribstane in Yorkshire, and that
when grace had been said after supper, the chaplain of the order
reprimanded the brethren, saying, “The devil will burn you;”
and hearing a bustle, he got up, and, as far as he recollects, saw
one of the brothers of the Temple, “brachis depositis, tenentem
faciem versus occidentem et posteriora versus altare!” He then
states, that about twenty years before that time, he was the guest
of the Templars, at the preceptory of Wetherby in Yorkshire,
and when evening came he heard that the preceptor was not
coming to supper, as he was arranging some relics that he had
brought with him from the Holy Land, and afterwards at midnight
he heard a confused noise in the chapel, and getting up
he looked through the keyhole, and saw a great light therein,
either from a fire or from candles, and on the morrow he asked
one of the brethren of the Temple the name of the saint in
whose honour they had celebrated so grand a festival during the
night, and that brother, aghast and turning pale, thinking he
had seen what had been done amongst them, said to him, “Go
thy way, and if you love me, or have any regard for your own
life, never speak of this matter!” Brother John de Wederel,
another Minorite, stated that he had lately <i>heard</i> in the country,
that a Templar, named Robert de Baysat, was once seen running
about a meadow uttering, “Alas! alas! that ever I was born,
seeing that I have denied God and sold myself to the devil!”
Brother N. de Chinon, another Minorite, had <i>heard</i> that a certain
Templar had a son who peeped through a chink in the wall of
the chapter-room and saw a person who was about to be professed,
slain because he would not deny Christ, and afterwards
the boy was asked by his father to become a Templar, but refused,
and he immediately shared the same fate. Twenty other
witnesses, who were examined in each other’s presence, related
similar absurdities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>At this stage of the proceedings, the papal inquisitor, Sicard
de Vaur, exhibited two rack-extorted confessions of Templars
which had been obtained in France. The first was from Robert
de St. Just, who had been received into the order by Brother
Himbert, Grand Preceptor of England, but had been arrested in
France, and there tortured. In this confession Robert de St.
Just states that, on his admission to the vows of the Temple,
he denied Christ, and spat <i>beside</i> the cross. The second confession
had been extorted from Geoffrey de Gonville, Knight of
the Order of the Temple, Preceptor of Aquitaine and Poitou.
In this confession, (which had been revoked, but of which revocation
no notice was taken by the inquisitors,) Geoffrey de
Gonville states that he was received into the order in England
in the house of the Temple at London, by Brother Robert de
Torvile, Knight, the Master of all England, about twenty-eight
years before that time; that the Master showed him on a missal
the image of Jesus Christ on the cross, and commanded him to
deny him who was crucified; that, terribly alarmed, he exclaimed,
“Alas! my lord, why should I do this? I will on no
account do it.” But the Master said to him, “Do it boldly; I
swear to thee that the act shall never harm either thy soul or
thy conscience;” and then proceeded to inform him that the
custom had been introduced into the order by a certain bad
Grand Master, who was imprisoned by a certain sultan, and
could escape from prison only on condition that he would
establish that form of reception in his order, and compel all
who were received to deny Christ Jesus! but the deponent remained
inflexible; he refused to deny his Saviour, and asked
where were his uncle and the other good people who had
brought him there, and was told that they were all gone; and
at last a compromise took place between him and the Master,
who made him take his oath that he would tell all his brethren
that he had gone through the customary form, and never reveal
that it had been dispensed with! He states also that the cere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>mony
was instituted in memory of St. Peter, who three times
denied Christ! This knight had been tortured in the Temple
at Paris, by the brothers of St. Dominic, in the presence of the
grand inquisitor, and he made his confession when suffering on
the rack; he afterwards revoked it, and was then tortured into
a withdrawal of his revocation, notwithstanding which the inquisitor
made the unhappy wretch, in common with others, put
his signature to the following interrogatory, “Interrogatus,
utrum <i>vi</i> vel <i>metu carceris</i> aut <i>tormentorum</i> immiscuit in suâ
depositione aliquam falsitatem, dicit <i>quod non</i>!”</p>

<p>Ferinsius le Mareschal, a secular knight, being examined,
declared that his grandfather entered into the order of the
Temple, active, healthy, and blithesome as the birds and the
dogs, but on the third day from his taking the vows he was
dead, and, as he <i>now suspects</i>, was killed because he refused to
participate in the iniquities practised by the brethren. An
Augustine monk declared that he had heard a Templar say that
a man after death had no more soul than a dog. Brother John
de Gertia, a Minorite, had <i>heard</i> from a certain woman called
Cacocaca! who had it from Exvalettus, Preceptor of London,
that one of the servants of the Templars entered the Temple
hall where the chapter was held, and secreted himself, and after
the door had been shut and locked by the last Templar who
entered, and the key had been brought by him to the superior,
the assembled Templars jumped up and went into another
room, and opened a closet, and drew therefrom a certain black
figure with shining eyes, and a cross, and they placed the cross
before the Master, and the “culum idoli vel figuræ” they placed
upon the cross, and carried it to the Master, who kissed the said
image, (in ano,) and all the others did the same after him; and
when they had finished kissing, they all spat three times upon
the cross, except one, who refused, saying, “I was a bad man in
the world, and placed myself in this order for the salvation of
my soul; what could I do worse? I will not do it;” and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
the brethren said to him, “Take heed, and do as you see
the order do;” but he answered that he would not do so,
and then they placed him in a well which stood in the midst
of their house, and covered the well up, and left him to perish.
Being asked as to the time when the woman heard this, the
deponent stated that she told it to him about fourteen years
back at London, where she kept a shop for her husband, Robert
Cotacota!</p>

<p>John Walby de Bust, another Minorite, had <i>heard</i> John de
Dingeston say that <i>he had heard</i> that there was in a secret place
of the house of the Templars at London a gilded head, and that
when one of the masters was on his death-bed, he summoned to
his presence several preceptors, and told them that if they
wished for power, and dominion, and honour, they must worship
that head. Gaspar de Nafferton, chaplain of the parish of
Ryde, deposed that he was in the employ of the Templars when
William de Pokelington was received into the order; that he
well recollected that the said William made his appearance at
the Temple on Sunday evening, with the equipage and habit of
a member of the order, accompanied by Brother William de la
More, the Master of the Temple, Brother William de Grafton,
Preceptor of Ribbestane and Fontebriggs, and other brethren:
that the same night, during the first watch, they assembled in
the church, and caused the deponent to be awakened to say
mass; that, after the celebration of the mass, they made the
deponent with his clerk go out into the hall beyond the cloister,
and then sent for the person who was to be received; and on
his entry into the church, one of the brethren immediately
closed all the doors opening into the cloister, so that no one
within the chambers could get out, and thus they remained till
daylight; but what was done in the church the deponent knew
not; the next day, however, he saw the said William clothed in
the habit of a Templar, looking very sorrowful. The deponent
also declared that he had threatened to peep through a secret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
door to see what was going on, but was warned that it was
inevitable death so to do. He states that the next morning
he went into the church, and found the books and crosses all
removed from the places in which he had previously left
them.</p>

<p>The evidence given before this papal tribunal affords melancholy
proof of the immorality, the credulity, and the profligacy
of the age. Abandoned women were brought before the inquisitors,
and were induced unblushingly to relate, in the presence
of the archbishop of Canterbury and the English bishops, the
most disgusting and ridiculous enormities; and evidence was
taken down by notaries, and quietly listened to by the most
learned and distinguished characters of the age, which in these
days would be scouted with scorn and contempt from almost
every court in Christendom.<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> On the 22nd of April all the
Templars in custody in the Tower and in the prisons of the
city were assembled before the inquisitors and the bishops of
London and Chichester, in the church of the Holy Trinity, to
hear the depositions of the witnesses publicly read. The
Templars required copies of these depositions, which were
granted them, and they were allowed eight days from that period
to bring forward any defences or privileges they wished to make
use of. Subsequently, before the expiration of the eight days,
the officer of the bishop of London was sent to the Tower with
scriveners and witnesses, to know if they would then set up any
matters of defence, to whom the Templars replied that they
were unlettered men, ignorant of the law, and that all means of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
defence were denied them, since they were not permitted to
employ those who could afford them fit counsel and advice.
They observed, however, that they were desirous of publicly
proclaiming the faith, and the religion of themselves and of the
order to which they belonged, of showing the privileges conceded
to them by the chief pontiffs, and their own depositions
taken before the inquisitors, all which they said they wished to
make use of in their defence.</p>

<p>On the eighth day, being Thursday the 29th of April, they
appeared before the papal inquisitors and the bishops of London
and Chichester, in the church of All Saints of Berkyngecherche,
and presented to them the following declaration, which they
had drawn up amongst themselves, as the only defence they
had to offer against the injustice, the tyranny, and the persecution
of their powerful oppressors; adding, that if they had in
any way done wrong, they were ready to submit themselves to
the orders of the church. This declaration is written in the
Norman French of that day, and is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“<i>Conue chese seit a nostre honurable père, le ercevesque de Canterbiere,

<p>“Be it known to our honourable father, the archbishop of
Canterbury, primate of all England, and to all the prelates of
holy church, and to all Christians, that all we brethren of the
Temple here assembled, and every of one of us are Christians,
and believe in our Saviour Jesus Christ, in God the Father
omnipotent, &amp;c., &amp;c.... And we believe all that the holy
church believes and teaches us. We declare that our religion is
founded on vows of obedience, chastity, and poverty, and of
aiding in the conquest of the Holy Land of Jerusalem, with all
the power and might that God affordeth us. And we firmly
deny and contradict, one and all of us, all manner of heresy and
evil doings, contrary to the faith of holy church. And for the
love of God, and for charity, we beseech you, who represent our
holy father the pope, that we may be treated like true children
of the church, for we have well guarded and preserved the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
faith, and the law of the church, and of our own religion, that
which is good, honest, and just, according to the ordinances
and the privileges of the court of Rome, granted, confirmed, and
canonized by common council; the which privileges, together
with the rule of our order, are enregistered in the said court.
And we would bring forward all Christians, (save our enemies
and slanderers,) with whom we are conversant, and among
whom we have resided, to say how and in what manner we have
spent our lives. And if, in our examinations, we have said or
done anything wrong through ignorance of a word, since we are
unlettered men, we are ready to suffer for holy church like him
who died for us on the blessed cross. And we believe all the
sacraments of the church. And we beseech you, for the love of
God, and as you hope to be saved, that you judge us as you
will have to answer for yourselves and for us before God; and
we pray that our examination may be read and heard before
ourselves and all the people, in the very language and words
in which it was given before you, and written down on paper.”</p>

<p>The above declaration was presented by Brother William de
la More, the Master of the Temple; the Knights Templars
Philip de Mewes, Preceptor of Garwy; William de Burton, Preceptor
of Cumbe; Radulph de Maison, Preceptor of Ewell;
Michael de Baskevile, Preceptor of London; Thomas de Wothrope,
Preceptor of Bistelesham; William de Warwick, Priest;
and Thomas de Burton, Chaplain of the Order; together with
twenty serving brothers. The same day the inquisitors and
the two bishops proceeded to the different prisons of the city to
demand if the prisoners confined therein wished to bring forward
anything in defence of the order, who severally answered
that they would adopt and abide by the declaration made by
their brethren in the Tower. In the prison of Aldgate there
were confined Brother William de Sautre, Knight, Preceptor of
Samford; Brother William de la Ford, Preceptor of Daney;
Brother John de Coningeston, Preceptor of Getinges; Roger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
de Norreis, Preceptor of Cressing; Radolph de Barton, priest,
Prior of the New Temple; and several serving brethren of the
order. In the prison of Crepelgate were detained William de
Egendon, Knight, Preceptor of Schepeley; John de Moun,
Knight, Preceptor of Dokesworth; and four serving brethren.
In the prison of Ludgate were five serving brethren; and in
Newgate was confined Brother Himbert Blanke, Knight, Grand
Preceptor of Auvergne.</p>

<p>The above declaration of faith and innocence was far from
agreeable to the papal inquisitors, who required a confession of
<i>guilt</i>, and the torture was once more directed to be applied.
The king sent fresh orders to the mayor and the sheriffs of the
city of London, commanding them to place the Templars in
separate dungeons; to load them with chains and fetters; to
permit the myrmidons of the inquisitors to pay periodical visits
to see that the wishes and intentions of the inquisitors, with
regard to the severity of the confinement, were properly carried
into effect; and lastly, to inflict <span class="small">TORTURE</span> upon the bodies of the
Templars, and generally to do whatever should be thought
fitting and expedient in the premises, according to the ecclesiastical
law. In conformity with these orders, we learn from the
record of the proceedings, that the Templars were placed in
solitary confinement in loathsome dungeons; that they were
put on a short allowance of bread and water, and periodically
visited by the agents of the inquisition; that they were moved
from prison to prison, and from dungeon to dungeon; were
now treated with rigour, and anon with indulgence; and were
then visited by learned prelates, and acute doctors in theology,
who, by exhortation, persuasion, and by menace, attempted in
every possible mode to wring from them the required avowals!
We learn that all the engines of terror wielded by the church
were put in force, and that torture was unsparingly applied
“<i>usque ad judicium sanguinis!</i>” The places in which these atrocious
scenes were enacted were the Tower, the prisons of Ald<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>gate,
Ludgate, Newgate, Bishopgate, and Crepelgate, the house
formerly belonging to John de Banguel, and the tenements once
the property of the brethren of penitence.<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> It appears that
some French monks were sent over to administer the torture to
the unhappy captives, and that they were questioned and examined
in the presence of notaries whilst suffering under the
torments of the rack. The relentless perseverance and the
incessant exertions of the foreign inquisitors were at last rewarded
by a splendid triumph over the powers of endurance of
two poor serving brethren, and one chaplain of the order, who
were at last induced to make the long desired avowals.</p>

<p>On the 23rd of June, Brother Stephen de Staplebrugge, described
as an apostate and fugitive of the order of the Temple,
captured by the king’s officers in the city of Salisbury, deposed
in the house of the head gaoler of Newgate, in the presence of
the bishops of London and Chichester, the chancellor of the
archbishop of Canterbury, Hugh de Walkeneby, doctor of theology,
and other clerical witnesses, that there were two modes
of profession in the order of the Temple, the one good and
lawful, and the other contrary to the christian faith; that he
himself was received into the order by Brother Brian le Jay,
Grand Preceptor of England, at Dynneslee, and was led into
the chapel, the door of which was closed as soon as he had
entered; that a crucifix was placed before the Master, and that a
brother of the Temple, with a drawn sword, stood on either
side of him; that the Master said to him, “Do you see this
image of the crucifixion?” to which he replied, “I see it, my
lord;” that the Master then said to him, “You must deny that
Christ Jesus was God and man, and that Mary was his mother;
and you must spit upon this cross;” which the deponent,
through immediate fear of death, did with his mouth, but not
with his heart, and he spat <i>beside</i> the cross, and not on it; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
then falling down upon his knees, with eyes uplifted, with his
hands clasped, with bitter tears and sighs, and devout ejaculations,
he besought the mercy and the favour of holy church,
declaring that he cared not for the death of the body, or for any
amount of penance, but only for the salvation of his soul!</p>

<p>On Saturday, the 25th of June, Brother Thomas Tocci de
Thoroldeby, serving brother of the order of the Temple, described
as an apostate who had escaped from Lincoln after his
examination at that place by the papal inquisitors, but had
afterwards surrendered himself to the king’s officers, was brought
before the bishops of London and Chichester, the archdeacon of
Salisbury, and others of the clergy in St. Martin’s Church, in
Vinetriâ; and being again examined, he repeated the statement
made in his first deposition, but added some particulars with
regard to penances imposed and absolutions pronounced in the
chapter, showing the difference between sins and defaults, the
priest having to deal with the one, and the Master with the
other. He declared that the little cords were worn from honourable
motives, and relates a story of his being engaged in a
battle against the Saracens, in which he lost his cord, and was
punished by the Grand Master for a default in coming home
without it. He gives the same account of the secrecy of the
chapters as all the other brethren, states that the members of
the order were forbidden to confess to the friars mendicants,
and were enjoined to confess to their own chaplains; that they
did nothing contrary to the christian faith, and as to their endeavouring
to promote the advancement of the order by any
means, right or wrong, that exactly the contrary was the case,
as there was a statute in the order to the effect, that if any one
should be found to have acquired anything unjustly, he should
be deprived of his habit, and be expelled the order. Being
asked what induced him to become an apostate, and to fly from
his order, he replied that it was through fear of death, because
the abbot of Lagny, (the papal inquisitor,) when he examined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
him at Lincoln, asked him if he would not confess anything
further, and he answered that he knew of nothing further to
confess, unless he was to say things that were not true; and
that <i>the abbot, laying his hand upon his breast, swore by the word
of God that he would make him confess before he had done with him!</i>
and that being terribly frightened, he afterwards bribed the
gaoler of the castle of Lincoln, giving him forty florins to let
him make his escape.</p>

<p>The abbot of Lagny, indeed, was as good as his word, for on
the 29th of June, four days after this imprudent avowal, Brother
Thomas Tocci de Thoroldeby was brought back to St. Martin’s
Church, and there, in the presence of the same parties, he made
a third confession, in which he declares that, coerced by two
Templars with drawn swords in their hands, he denied Christ
with his mouth, but not with his heart; and spat <i>beside</i> the
cross, but not on it; that he was required to spit upon the
image of the Virgin Mary, but contrived, instead of doing so, to
give her a kiss on the foot. He declares that he had heard
Brian le Jay, the Master of the Temple at London, say a hundred
times over, that Jesus Christ was not the true God, but a
man: and that the smallest hair out of the beard of one Saracen,
was of more worth than the whole body of any Christian. He
declares that he was once standing in the presence of Brother
Brian, when some poor people besought charity of him for the
love of God and our lady the blessed Virgin Mary; and he
answered, “<i>Que dame, alez vous pendre a vostre dame</i>”&mdash;“What
lady, go and be hanged to your lady,” and violently casting a
halfpenny into the mud, he made the poor people hunt for it,
although it was in the depth of a severe winter. He also relates
that, at the chapters, the priest stood like a beast, and had
nothing to do but to repeat the psalm, “God be merciful unto
us, and bless us,” which was read at the closing of the chapter.
(The Templars, by the way, must have been strange idolaters to
have closed their chapters, in which they are accused of wor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>shipping
a cat, a man’s head, and a black idol, with the reading
of the beautiful psalm, “God be merciful unto us, and bless us,
and show us the light of thy countenance, that thy way may be
known upon earth, thy saving health among all nations,” &amp;c.,
Psalm lxvii.) This witness further states, that the priest had
no power to impose a heavier penance than a day’s fast on bread
and water, and could not even do that without the permission
of the brethren. He is made also to relate that the Templars
always favoured the Saracens in the holy wars in Palestine, and
oppressed the Christians! and he declares, speaking of himself,
that for three years before he had never seen the body of Christ
without thinking of the devil, nor could he remove that evil
thought from his heart by prayer, or in any other way that he
knew of; but that very morning he had heard mass with great
devotion, and since then had thought only of Christ, and thinks
there is no one in the order of the Temple whose soul will be
saved, unless a reformation takes place.</p>

<p>Previous to this period, the ecclesiastical council had again
assembled, and these last depositions of Brother Stephen de
Stapelbrugge and Thomas Tocci de Thoroldeby having been
produced before them, the solemn farce of their confession and
abjuration was immediately publicly enacted. It is thus described
in the record of the proceedings:&mdash;“To the praise and
glory of the name of the most high Father, and of the Son, and
of the Holy Ghost, to the confusion of heretics, and the
strengthening of all faithful Christians, begins the public record
of the reconciliation of the penitent heretics, returning to the
orthodox faith published in the council, celebrated at London in
the year 1311. In the name of God, Amen. In the year of
the incarnation of our Lord, 1311, on the twenty-seventh day of
the month of June, in the hall of the palace of the bishop of
London, before the venerable fathers the Lord Robert by the
grace of God archbishop of Canterbury, primate of all England,
and his suffragans in provincial council assembled, appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
Brother Stephen de Stapelbrugge, of the order of the chivalry of
the Temple; and the denying of Christ and the blessed Virgin
Mary his mother, the spitting upon the cross, and the heresies
and errors acknowledged and confessed by him in his deposition,
being displayed, the same Stephen asserted in full council,
before the people of the city of London, introduced for the
occasion, that all those things so deposed by him were true,
and that to that confession he would wholly adhere; humbly
confessing his error on his bended knees, with his hands clasped,
with much lamentation and many tears, he again and again
besought the mercy and pity of holy mother church, offering to
abjure all heresies and errors, and praying them to impose on
him a fitting penance, and then the book of the holy gospels
being placed in his hands, he abjured the aforesaid heresies in
this form ;&mdash;‘I, Brother Stephen de Stapelbrugge, of the order
of the chivalry of the Temple, do solemnly confess,’ &amp;c., &amp;c.,
(he repeats his confession, makes his abjuration, and then proceeds;)
‘and if at any time hereafter I shall happen to relapse into
the same errors, or deviate from any of the articles of the faith,
I will account myself <i>ipso facto</i> excommunicated; I will stand
condemned as a manifest perjured heretic, and the punishment
inflicted on perjured relapsed heretics, shall be forthwith imposed
upon me without further trial or judgment!!’”</p>

<p>He was then sworn upon the holy gospels to stand to the sentence
of the church in the matter, after which Brother Thomas
Tocci de Thoroldeby was brought forward to go through the
same ceremony, which being concluded, these two poor serving
brothers of the order of the Temple, who were so ignorant that
they could not write, were made to place their mark on the record
of their abjuration. “And then our lord the archbishop of
Canterbury, for the purpose of absolving and reconciling to the
unity of the church the aforesaid Thomas and Stephen, conceded
his authority and that of the whole council to the bishop
of London, in the presence of me the notary, specially summoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
for the occasion, in these words: ‘We grant to you the authority
of God, of the blessed Mary, of the blessed Thomas the
Martyr our patron, and of all the saints of God (sanctorum atque
<i>sanctarum</i> Dei) to us conceded, and also the authority of the present
council to us transferred, to the end that thou mayest reconcile
to the unity of the church these miserables, separated
from her by their repudiation of the faith, and now brought back
again to her bosom, reserving to ourselves and the council the
right of imposing a fit penance for their transgressions!’ And
as there were two penitents, the bishop of Chichester was joined
to the bishop of London for the purpose of pronouncing the absolution,
which two bishops, putting on their mitres and pontificals,
and being assisted by twelve priests in sacerdotal vestments,
placed themselves in seats at the western entrance of the
cathedral church of St. Paul, and the penitents, with bended
knees, humbly prostrating themselves in prayer upon the steps
before the door of the church, the members of the council and
the people of the city standing around; and the psalm, <i>Have
mercy upon me, O God, after thy great goodness</i>, having been
chaunted from the beginning to the end, and the subjoined
prayers and sermon having been gone through, they absolved
the said penitents, and received them back to the unity of the
church in the following form:&mdash;‘In the name of God, Amen.
Since by your confession we find that you, Brother Stephen de
Stapelbrugge, have denied Christ Jesus and the blessed Virgin
Mary, and have spate <i>beside</i> the cross, and now taking better advice
wishest to return to the unity of the holy church with a true
heart and sincere faith, as you assert, and all heretical depravity
having for that purpose been previously abjured by you according
to the form of the church, we, by the authority of the council,
absolve you from the bond of excommunication wherewith you
were held fast, and we reconcile you to the unity of the church,
if you shall have returned to her in sincerity of heart, and shall
have obeyed her injunctions imposed upon you.’” Brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
Thomas Tocci de Thoroldeby was then absolved and reconciled
to the church in the usual manner, after which various psalms
(Gloria Patri, Kyrie Eleyson, Christe Eleyson, &amp;c. &amp;c.) were
sung, and prayers were offered up, and then the ceremony was
concluded.</p>

<p>On the 1st of July, an avowal of guilt was wrung by the inquisitors
from Brother John de Stoke, chaplain of the order, who,
being brought before the bishops of London and Chichester in St.
Martin’s Church, deposed that he was received in the mode mentioned
by him on his first examination; but a year and fifteen
days after that reception, being at the preceptory of Garwy in
the diocese of Hereford, he was called into the chamber of Brother
James de Molay, the Grand Master of the order, who, in the
presence of two other Templars of foreign extraction, informed
him that he wished to make proof of his obedience, and commanded
him to take a seat at the foot of the bed, and the deponent
did so. The Grand Master then sent into the church
for the crucifix, and two serving brothers, with naked swords in
their hands, stationed themselves on either side of the doorway.
As soon as the crucifix made its appearance, the Grand Master,
pointing to the figure of our Saviour nailed thereon, asked the
deponent whose image it was, and he answered, “The image of
Jesus Christ, who suffered on the cross for the redemption of
mankind;” but the Grand Master exclaimed, “Thou sayest
wrong, and art much mistaken, for he was the son of a certain
woman, and was crucified because he called himself the Son of
God, and I myself have been in the place where he was born
and crucified, and thou must now deny him whom this image
represents.” The deponent exclaimed, “Far be it from me to
deny my Saviour;” but the Grand Master told him he must do
it, or he would be put into a sack and be carried to a place which
he would find by no means agreeable, and there were swords in
the room, and brothers ready to use them, &amp;c. &amp;c.; and the deponent
asked if such was the custom of the order, and if all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
brethren did the same; and being answered in the affirmative,
he, through fear of immediate death, denied Christ with his
<i>tongue</i>, but not with his <i>heart</i>. Being asked in whom he was
told to put his faith after he had denied Christ Jesus, he replies,
“In that great Omnipotent God who created the heaven and the
earth!”</p>

<p>On Monday, July 5th, at the request of the ecclesiastical
council, the bishop of Chichester had an interview with Sir
William de la More, the Master of the Temple, taking with him
certain learned lawyers, theologians, and scriveners. He exhorted
and earnestly pressed him to abjure the heresies of which
he stood convicted, by his own confessions and those of his brethren,
respecting the absolutions pronounced by him in the
chapters, and submit himself to the disposition of the church;
but the Master declared that he had never been guilty of the
heresies mentioned, and that he would not abjure crimes which
he had never committed; so he was sent back to his dungeon.
The next day, the bishops of London, Winchester, and Chichester,
had an interview in Southwark with the Knight Templar
Philip de Mewes, Preceptor of Garwy, and some serving brethren
of the New Temple at London, and told them that they were
manifestly guilty of heresy, as appeared from the pope’s bulls,
and the depositions taken against the order both in England
and France, and also from their own confessions regarding the
absolutions pronounced in their chapters, explaining to them
that they had grievously erred in believing that the Master of
the Temple, who was a mere layman, had power to absolve them
from their sins by pronouncing absolution, and they warned
them that if they persisted in that error they would be condemned
as heretics, and that, as they could not clear themselves
therefrom, it behoved them to abjure all the heresies of which
they were accused. The Templars replied that they were ready
to abjure the error they had fallen into respecting the absolution
and all heresies of every kind, before the archbishop of Canter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>bury
and the prelates of the council, whenever they should be
required so to do, and they humbly and reverently submitted
themselves to the orders of the church, beseeching pardon and
grace. A sort of compromise was then made with most of the
Templars in custody in London. They were required publicly
to repeat a form of confession and abjuration drawn up by the
bishops of London and Chichester, and were then solemnly absolved
and reconciled to the church.</p>

<p>On the 9th of July, Brother Michael de Baskevile, Knight,
Preceptor of London, and seventeen other Templars, were absolved
and reconciled in full council, in the Episcopal Hall of
the see of London, in the presence of a vast concourse of the
citizens. On the 10th of the same month, the Preceptors of
Dokesworth, Getinges, and Samford, the guardian of the Temple
church at London, Brother Radulph de Evesham, chaplain, with
other priests, knights, and serving brethren of the order, were
absolved by the bishops of London, Exeter, Winchester, and
Chichester, in the presence of the archbishop of Canterbury, and
the whole ecclesiastical council. The next day many more
members of the fraternity were publicly reconciled to the church
on the steps before the south door of Saint Paul’s cathedral, and
were afterwards present at the celebration of high mass in the
interior of the sacred edifice, when they advanced in a body towards
the high altar bathed in tears, and falling down on their
knees, they devoutly kissed the sacred emblems of Christianity.
The day after, (July 12,) nineteen other Templars were publicly
absolved and reconciled to the church in the same place, in the
presence of the earls of Leicester, Pembroke, and Warwick, and
afterwards assisted in like manner at the celebration of high
mass. The priests of the order made their confessions and abjurations
in Latin; the knights pronounced them in Norman
French, and the serving brethren for the most part repeated
them in English. The vast concourse of people collected together
could have comprehended but very little of what was uttered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
whilst the appearance of the penitent brethren, and the public
spectacle of their recantation, answered the views of the papal
inquisitors, and doubtless impressed the commonalty with a conviction
of the guilt of the order. Many of the Templars were
too <i>sick</i> (from the effect of torture) to be brought down to Saint
Paul’s, and were therefore absolved and reconciled to the church
by the bishops of London, Winchester, and Chichester, at Saint
Mary’s chapel near the Tower. Among these last were many
old veteran warriors in the last stage of decrepitude and decay.
“They were so old and so infirm,” says the public notary who
recorded the proceedings, “that they were unable to stand;”
their confessions were consequently made before two masters in
theology; they were then led before the west door of the chapel,
and were publicly reconciled to the church by the bishop of
Chichester; after which they were brought into the sacred
building, and were placed on their knees before the high altar,
which they devoutly kissed, whilst the tears trickled down their
furrowed cheeks. All these penitent Templars were now released
from prison, and directed to do penance in different monasteries.
Precisely the same form of proceeding was followed
at York; the reconciliation and absolution being there carried
into effect before the south door of the cathedral.<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>Similar measures had, in the mean time, been prosecuted
against the Templars in all parts of Christendom. On the
18th of March, the pope wrote to the kings of Castile, Leon,
Aragon, and Portugal, complaining of the omission to torture
the Templars in their dominions. “The bishops and delegates,”
says the holy pontiff, “have imprudently neglected these
means of obtaining the truth; we therefore expressly order them
to employ <span class="small">TORTURE</span> against the knights, that the truth may be
more readily and completely obtained!” The order for <span class="small">TORTURING</span>
the Templars was transmitted to the patriarch of Constantinople,
the bishop of Negropont, and the duke of Achaia; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
it crossed the seas to the king of Cyprus, and the bishops of
Famagousta and Nicosia! The councils of Tarragona and
Aragon, after applying the torture, pronounced the order free
from heresy. In Portugal and in Germany the Templars were
declared innocent: and in no place situate beyond the sphere
of the influence of the king of France and his creature the pope
was a single Templar condemned to death.<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>On the 16th of October the general council of the church
which had been convened by the pope to pronounce the abolition
of the order, assembled at Vienne, near Lyons in France.
It was opened by the holy pontiff in person, who caused the different
confessions and avowals of the Templars to be read over
before the assembled nobles and prelates. Although the order
was now broken up, and the best and bravest of its members had
either perished in the flames or were languishing in dungeons,
yet nine fugitive Templars had the courage to present themselves
before the council, and demand to be heard in defence of
their order, declaring that they were the representatives of from
1,500 to 2,000 Templars, who were wandering about as fugitives
and outlaws in the neighbourhood of Lyons. Monsieur Raynouard
has fortunately brought to light a letter from the pope
to king Philip, which states this fact, and also informs us how
the holy pontiff acted when he heard that these defenders of
the order had presented themselves. Clement caused them to
be thrown into prison, where they languished and died. He
affected to believe that his life was in danger from the number
of the Templars at large, and he immediately took measures to
provide for the security of his person.</p>

<p>The assembled fathers, to their honour, expressed their disapprobation
of this flagrant act of injustice, and the entire
council, with the exception of an Italian prelate, nephew of the
pope, and the three French bishops of Rheims, Sens, and
Rouen, all creatures of Philip, who had severally condemned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
large bodies of Templars to be burnt at the stake in their respective
dioceses, were unanimously of opinion, that before the
suppression of so celebrated and illustrious an order, which had
rendered such great and signal services to the christian faith,
the members belonging to it ought to be heard in their own
defence.<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> Such a proceeding, however did not suit the views
of the pope and king Philip, and the assembly was abruptly
dismissed by the holy pontiff, who declared that since they
were unwilling to adopt the necessary measures, he himself,
out of the plenitude of the papal authority, would supply every
defect. Accordingly, at the commencement of the following
year, the pope summoned a private consistory; and several
cardinals and French bishops having been gained over, the holy
pontiff abolished the order by an apostolical ordinance, perpetually
prohibiting every one from thenceforth entering into it, or
accepting or wearing the habit thereof, or representing themselves
to be Templars, on pain of excommunication.<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>On the 3rd of April, the second session of the council was
opened by the pope at Vienne. King Philip and his three sons
were present, accompanied by a large body of troops, and the
papal decree abolishing the order was published before the assembly.
The members of the council appear to have been
called together merely to hear the decree read. History does
not inform us of any discussion with reference to it, nor of any
suffrages having been taken. A few months after the close of
these proceedings, Brother William de la More, the Master of
the Temple in England, died of a broken heart in his solitary
dungeon in the Tower, persisting with his last breath in the
maintenance of the innocence of his order. King Edward, in
pity for his misfortunes, directed the constable of the Tower to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
hand over his goods and chattels, valued at the sum of 4<i>l.</i> 19<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i>,
to his executors, to be employed in the liquidation of his debts,
and he commanded Geoffrey de la Lee, guardian of the lands of
the Templars, to pay the arrears of his prison pay (2<i>s.</i> per diem)
to the executor, Roger Hunsingon.</p>

<p>The only other Templar in England whose fate merits particular
attention is Brother Himbert Blanke, the Grand Preceptor
of Auvergne. He appears to have been a knight of high
honour and of stern unbending pride. From first to last he had
boldly protested against the violent proceedings of the inquisitors,
and had fearlessly maintained, amid all his trials, his
own innocence and that of his order. This illustrious Templar
had fought under four successive Grand Masters in defence of
the christian faith in Palestine, and, after the fall of Acre, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
led in person several daring expeditions against the infidels.
For these meritorious services he was rewarded in the following
manner:&mdash;After having been tortured and half-starved in the
English prisons for the space of five years, he was condemned,
as he would make no confession of guilt, to be shut up in a
loathsome dungeon, to be loaded with double chains, and to be
occasionally visited by the agents of the Inquisition, to see if
he would confess <i>nothing further</i>.<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> In this miserable situation
he remained until death at last put an end to his sufferings.</p>

<p>James de Molay, the Grand Master of the Temple, Guy, the
Grand Preceptor, a nobleman of illustrious birth, brother to
the prince of Dauphiny, Hugh de Peralt, the Visitor-general of
the order, and the Grand Preceptor of Aquitaine, had now languished
in the prisons of France for the space of five years and
a half. The secrets of their dark dungeons were never brought
to light, but on the 18th of March, <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1313, a public scaffold
was erected before the cathedral church of Notre Dame, at Paris,
and the citizens were summoned to hear the order of the Temple
convicted by the mouths of its chief officers, of the sins and
iniquities charged against it. The four knights, loaded with
chains and surrounded by guards, were then brought upon the
scaffold by the provost, and the bishop of Alba read their confessions
aloud in the presence of the assembled populace. The
papal legate then, turning towards the Grand Master and his
companions, called upon them to renew, in the hearing of the
people, the avowals which they had previously made of the guilt
of their order. Hugh de Peralt, the Visitor-general, and the
Preceptor of the Temple of Aquitaine, signified their assent to
whatever was demanded of them, but the Grand Master, raising
his arms bound with chains towards heaven, and advancing to
the edge of the scaffold, declared in a loud voice, that to say
that which was untrue was a crime, both in the sight of God
and man. “I do,” said he, “confess my guilt, which consists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
in having, to my shame and dishonour, suffered myself, through
the pain of torture and the fear of death, to give utterance to
falsehoods, imputing scandalous sins and iniquities to an illustrious
order, which hath nobly served the cause of Christianity.
I disdain to seek a wretched and disgraceful existence by engrafting
another lie upon the original falsehood.” He was here
interrupted by the provost and his officers, and Guy, the Grand
Preceptor, having commenced with strong asseverations of his
innocence, they were both hurried back to prison.</p>

<p>King Philip was no sooner informed of the result, than, upon
the first impulse of his indignation, without consulting either
pope, or bishop, or ecclesiastical council, he commanded the
instant execution of both these gallant noblemen. The same
day at dusk they were led out of their dungeons, and were
burned to death in a slow and lingering manner upon small
fires of charcoal which were kindled on the little island in the
Seine, between the king’s garden and the convent of Saint
Augustine, close to the spot where now stands the equestrian
statue of Henri IV.<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> Thus perished the last Grand Master of
the Temple.</p>

<p>The fate of the persecutors of the order is not unworthy of
notice.</p>

<p>A year and one month after the above horrible execution, the
pope was attacked by a dysentery, and speedily hurried to his
grave. The dead body was transported to Carpentras, where the
court of Rome then resided; it was placed at night in a church
which caught fire, and the mortal remains of the holy pontiff
were almost entirely consumed. His relations quarrelled over
the immense treasures he left behind him, and a vast sum of
money, which had been deposited for safety in a church at
Lucca, was stolen by a daring band of German and Italian freebooters.
Before the close of the same year, king Philip died<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
of a lingering disease which had baffled all the art of his medical
attendants, and the condemned criminal, upon the strength
of whose information the Templars were originally arrested, was
hanged for fresh crimes. “History attests,” says Monsieur
Raynouard, “that all those who were foremost in the persecution
of the Templars, came to an untimely and miserable death.
The last days of Philip were embittered by misfortune; his
nobles and clergy leagued against him to resist his exactions;
the wives of his three sons were accused of adultery, and two of
them were publicly convicted of that crime. The misfortunes
of Edward the Second, king of England, and his horrible
death in Berkeley Castle, are too well known to be further
alluded to.”</p>

<p>“The chief cause of the ruin of the Templars,” justly remarks
Fuller, “was their extraordinary wealth. As Naboth’s vineyard
was the chiefest ground of his blasphemy, and as in England
Sir John Cornwall Lord Fanhope said merrily, not he, but his
stately house at Ampthill, in Bedfordshire, was guilty of high
treason, so certainly their wealth was the principal cause of
their overthrow.... We may believe that king Philip would
never have taken away their lives if he might have taken their
lands without putting them to death, but the mischief was, he
could not get the honey unless he burnt the bees.” King Philip,
the pope, and the European sovereigns, appear to have disposed
of all the personalty of the Templars, the ornaments, jewels,
and treasures of their churches and chapels, and during the
period of five years, over which the proceedings against the
order extended, they remained in the actual receipt of the vast
rents and revenues of the fraternity. King Philip put forward
a claim upon their lands in France to the extent of two hundred
thousand pounds for the expenses of the prosecution, and Louis,
his son, claimed a further sum of sixty thousand pounds:
“J’ignore,” says Voltaire, “ce qui revint au pape, mais je vois
evidemment que les frais des cardinaux, des inquisiteurs déléguès<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
pour faire ce procès épouvantable monterent à des sommes immenses.”
The holy pontiff, according to his own account,
received only a <i>small portion</i> of the personalty of the order, but
others make him a large participator in the good things of the
fraternity.<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>On the imprisonment of the Templars in England, the Temple
at London, and all the preceptories dependent upon it, with
the manors, farms, houses, lands, and revenues of the order,
were placed under the survey of the Court of Exchequer, and
extents were directed to be taken of the same, after which they
were confided to the care of certain trustworthy persons, styled
“Guardians of the lands of the Templars,” who were to account
for the rents and profits to the king’s exchequer. These guardians
were directed to pay various pensions to the old servants
and retainers of the Templars dwelling in the different preceptories,
also the expenses of the prosecution against the order;
and they were at different times required to victual the king’s
castles and strongholds. In the month of February, <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1312,
the king gave the Temple manors of Etton and Cave to David,
earl of Athol, directing the guardians of the lands and tenements
of the Templars in the county of York to hand over to
the said earl all the corn in those manors, the oxen, calves,
ploughs, and all the goods and chattels of the Templars existing
therein, together with the ornaments and utensils of the
chapel of the Temple. But on the 16th of May the pope addressed
bulls to the king, and to all the earls and barons of the
kingdom, setting forth the proceedings of the council of Vienne,
and the publication of a papal decree, vesting the property late
belonging to the Templars in the brethren of the Hospital of
St. John, and he commands them forthwith to place the members
of that order in possession thereof. Bulls were also addressed
to the archbishops of Canterbury and York and their
suffragans, commanding them to enforce by ecclesiastical cen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>sures
the execution of the papal commands. King Edward and
his nobles very properly resisted this decree, and on the 21st of
August the king wrote to the Prior of the Hospital of St. John
at Clerkenwell, telling him that the pretensions of the pope to
dispose of property within the realm of England, without the
consent of parliament, were derogatory to the dignity of the
crown and the royal authority. The following year the king
granted the Temple at London, with the church and all the
buildings therein, to Aymer de Valence, earl of Pembroke; and
on the 5th of May of the same year, he caused several merchants,
from whom he had borrowed money, to be placed in
possession of many of the manors of the Templars.<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>Yielding, however, at last to the exhortations and menaces of
the pope, the king, on the 21st of Nov., <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1313, granted the
property to the Hospitallers, and sent orders to the guardians of
the lands of the Templars, and to various powerful barons who
were in possession of the estates, commanding them to deliver
them up to certain parties deputed by the Grand Master and
chapter of the Hospital of St. John to receive them. At this
period many of the heirs of the donors, whose title had been
recognised by the law, were in possession of the lands, and the
judges held that the king had no power of his own sole authority
to transfer them to the order of the Hospital. The thunders
of the Vatican were consequently vigorously made use of, and
all the detainers of the property were doomed by the Roman
pontiff to everlasting damnation. Pope John, in one of his
bulls, dated <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1322, bitterly complains of the disregard by all
the king’s subjects of the papal commands. He laments that
they had hardened their hearts and despised the sentence of excommunication
fulminated against them, and declares that his
heart was riven with grief to find that even the ecclesiastics, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
ought to have been as a wall of defence to the Hospitallers, had
themselves been heinously guilty in the premises.<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>At last (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1324) the pope, the bishops, and the Hospitallers,
by their united exertions, succeeded in obtaining an act
of parliament, vesting all the property late belonging to the
Templars in the brethren of the Hospital of St. John, in order
that the intentions of the donors might be carried into effect by
the appropriation of it to the defence of the Holy Land and the
succour of the christian cause in the East. This statute gave
rise to the greatest discontent. The heirs of the donors petitioned
parliament for its repeal, alleging that it had been made against
law, and against reason, and contrary to the opinion of the
judges; and many of the great barons who held the property by
a title recognised by the common law, successfully resisted the
claims of the order of the Hospital, maintaining that the parliament
had no right to interfere with the tenure of private property,
and to dispose of their possessions without their consent.
This struggle between the heirs of the donors on the one hand,
and the Hospitallers on the other, continued for a lengthened
period; and in the reign of Edward the Third it was found necessary
to pass another act of parliament, confirming the previous
statute in their favour, and writs were sent to the sheriffs (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span>
1334) commanding them to enforce the execution of the acts of
the legislature, and to take possession, in the king’s name, of all
the property unjustly detained from the brethren of the Hospital
of St. John.<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>Whilst the vast possessions, late belonging to the Templars,
thus continued to be the subject of contention, the surviving
brethren of that dissolved order continued to be treated with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
utmost inhumanity and neglect. The ecclesiastical council had
assigned to each of them a pension of fourpence a day for subsistence,
but this small pittance was not paid, and they were consequently
in great danger of dying of hunger. The king, pitying
their miserable situation, wrote to the prior of the hospital of St.
John at Clerkenwell, earnestly requesting him to take their hard
lot into his serious consideration, and not suffer them to come to
beggary in the streets. The archbishop of Canterbury also
exerted himself in their behalf, and sent letters to the possessors
of the property, reproving them for the non-payment of the
allotted stipends. “This inhumanity,” says he, “awakens our
compassion, and penetrates us with the most lively grief. We
pray and conjure you in kindness to furnish them, for the love
of God and for charity, with the means of subsistence.” The
archbishop of York caused many of them to be supported in the
different monasteries of his diocese.<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>We have already seen (ante, <a href="#Page_298">p. 298</a>) that the Temple at
London, the chief house of the English province of the order,
had been granted (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1313) by king Edward the Second to
Aymer de Valence, earl of Pembroke. As Thomas earl of Lancaster,
the king’s cousin and first prince of the blood, however,
claimed the Temple by escheat, as the immediate lord of the
fee, the earl of Pembroke, on the 3rd of October, <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1315, at
the request of the king, and in consideration of the grant to him
by his sovereign of other land, gave up the property to the earl
of Lancaster. This earl of Lancaster was president of the
council, and the most powerful and opulent subject of the kingdom,
and we are told that the students and professors of the
common law made interest with him for a lodging in the Temple,
and first gained a footing therein as his <i>lessees</i>. They took
possession of the old Hall and the gloomy cells of the military
monks, and converted them into the great and most ancient
Common Law University in England. From that period to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
present time the retreats of the religious warriors have been devoted
to “the studious and eloquent pleaders of causes,” a new
kind of <span class="smcap">Templars</span>, who, as Fuller quaintly observes, now “defend
one Christian from another, as the old ones did Christians
from Pagans.”</p>

<p>Subsequently to this event the fee simple or inheritance of
the place passed successively through various hands. On the
memorable attainder and ignominious execution before his
own castle of the earl of Lancaster it reverted to the crown, and
was again granted to Aymer de Valence, earl of Pembroke, who
was shortly afterwards murdered at Paris. He died without
issue, and the Temple accordingly once more vested in the
crown.<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> It was then granted to the royal favourite, Hugh le
Despenser the younger, and on his attainder and execution by
the Lancastrian faction, it came into the hands of the young
king Edward the Third, who had just then ascended the throne,
and was committed by him to the keeping of the Mayor of
London, his escheator in the city. The mayor closed the gate
leading to the waterside, which stood at the bottom of the present
Middle Temple Lane, whereby the lawyers were much incommoded
in their progress backwards and forwards from the
Temple to Westminster. Complaints were made to the king on
the subject, who, on the 2nd day of November, in the third year
of his reign, (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1330,) wrote as follows to the mayor:&mdash;“The
king to the mayor of London, his escheator in the same city.
Since we have been given to understand that there ought to be
a free passage through the court of the New Temple at London
to the river Thames, for our justices, clerks, and others, who
may wish to pass by water to Westminster to transact their
business, and that you keep the gate of the Temple shut by day,
and so prevent those same justices, clerks of ours, and other per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>sons,
from passing through the midst of the said court to the
waterside, whereby as well our own affairs as those of our people
in general are oftentimes greatly delayed, we command you, that
you keep the gates of the said Temple open by day, so that our
justices and clerks, and other persons who wish to go by water
to Westminster may be able so to do by the way to which they
have hitherto been accustomed.” The following year (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1331)
the king wrote to the mayor, his escheator in the city of London,
informing him that he had been given to understand that the
pier in the said court of the Temple, leading to the river, was so
broken and decayed, that his clerks and law officers, and others,
could no longer get across it, and were consequently prevented
from passing by water to Westminster. “We therefore,” he
proceeds, “being desirous of providing such a remedy as we
ought for this evil, command you to do whatever repairs are
necessary to the said pier, and to defray the cost thereof out of
the proceeds of the lands and rents appertaining to the said
Temple now in your custody; and when we shall have been informed
of the things done in the matter, the expense shall be
allowed you in your account of the same proceeds.”<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>Two years afterwards (6 E. III., <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1333) the king committed
the custody of the Temple to “his beloved clerk,” William
de Langford, “and farmed out the rents and proceeds thereof
to him for the term of ten years, at a rent of 24<i>l.</i> per annum, the
said William undertaking to keep all the houses and tenements
in good order and repair, and so deliver them up at the end of
the term.” In the mean time, however, the pope and the bishops
had been vigorously exerting themselves to obtain a transfer of
the property to the order of the Knights Hospitallers of Saint
John. The Hospitallers petitioned the king, setting forth that
the church, the cloisters, and other places within the Temple,
were consecrated and dedicated to the service of God, that they
had been unjustly occupied and detained from them by Hugh le<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
Despenser the younger, and, through his attainder, had lately
come into the king’s hands, and they besought the king to deliver
up to them possession thereof. King Edward accordingly
commanded the mayor of London, his escheator in that city, to
take inquisition concerning the premises.</p>

<p>From this inquisition, and the return thereof, it appears that
many of the founders of the Temple Church, and many of the
brethren of the order of Knights Templars, then lay buried in
the church and cemetery of the Temple; that the bishop of Ely
had his lodging in the Temple, known by the name of the bishop
of Ely’s chamber; that there was a chapel dedicated to St.
Thomas-à-Becket, which extended from the door of the <span class="smcap">Temple
Hall</span> as far as the ancient gate of the Temple; also a cloister
which began at the bishop of Ely’s chamber, and ran in an
easterly direction; and that there was a wall which ran in a
northerly direction as far as the said king’s highway; that in the
front part of the cemetery towards the north, bordering on the
king’s highway, were thirteen houses formerly erected, with the
assent and permission of the Master and brethren of the Temple,
by Roger Blom, a messenger of the Temple, for the purpose of
holding the lights and ornaments of the church; that the land
whereon these houses were built, the cemetery, the church, and
all the space enclosed between St. Thomas’s chapel, the church,
the cloisters, and the wall running in a northerly direction, and
all the buildings erected thereon, together with the hall, cloisters,
and St. Thomas’ chapel, were sanctified places dedicated to God;
that Hugh le Despenser occupied and detained them unjustly,
and that through his attainder and forfeiture, and not otherwise,
they came into the king’s hands.<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>After the return of this inquisition, the said sanctified places
were assigned to the prior and brethren of the Hospital of Saint
John; and the king, on the 11th of January, in the tenth year of
his reign, <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1337, directed his writ to the barons of the Ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>chequer,
commanding them to take inquisition of the value of
the said sanctified places, so given up to the Hospitallers, and of
the residue of the Temple, and certify the same under their seals
to the king, in order that a reasonable abatement might be made
in William de Langford’s rent. From the inquiry made in pursuance
of this writ before John de Shoreditch, a baron of the
Exchequer, it further appears that on the said residue of the
Temple upon the land then remaining in the custody of William
de Langford, and withinside the great gate of the Temple, were
another <span class="small">HALL</span> and four chambers connected therewith, a kitchen,
a garden, a stable, and a chamber beyond the great gate; also
eight shops, seven of which stood in Fleet Street, and the eighth
in the suburb of London, without the bar of the New Temple;
that the annual value of these shops varied from ten to thirteen,
fifteen, and sixteen shillings; that the fruit out of the garden of
the Temple sold for sixty shillings per annum in the gross, that
seven out of the thirteen houses erected by Roger Blom were
each of the annual value of eleven shillings; and that the eighth,
situated beyond the gate of entrance to the church, was worth
four marks per annum. It appears, moreover, that the total annual
revenue of the Temple then amounted to 73<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i>, equal
to about 1,000<i>l.</i> of our present money, and that William de Langford
was abated 12<i>l.</i> 4<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> of the said rent.<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>Three years after the taking of this inquisition, and in the
thirteenth year of his reign, <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1340, king Edward the Third,
in consideration of the sum of one hundred pounds, which the
prior of the Knights Hospitallers promised to pay him towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
the expense of his expedition into France, granted to the said
prior all the residue of the Temple then remaining in the king’s
hands, to hold, together with the cemetery, cloisters, and the
other sanctified places, to the said prior and his brethren, and
their successors, of the king and his heirs, for charitable purposes,
for ever. From this grant it appears that the porter of
the Temple received sixty shillings and tenpence per annum,
and twopence a day wages, which were to be paid him by the
Hospitallers. At this period Philip Thane was prior of the
Hospital; and he exerted himself to impart to the celebration of
divine service in the Temple Church, the dignity and the splendour
it possessed in the time of the Templars. He, with the
unanimous consent and approbation of the whole chapter of the
Hospital, granted to Hugh de Lichefield, priest, and to his successors,
guardians of the Temple Church, towards the improvement
of the lights and the celebration of divine service therein,
all the land called Ficketzfeld, and the garden called Cotterell
Garden; and two years afterwards he made a further grant, to
the said Hugh and his successors, of a thousand fagots a year to
be cut out of the wood of Lilleston, and carried to the New
Temple to keep up the fire in the said church.<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>King Edward III., in the thirty-fifth year of his reign, <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span>
1362, notwithstanding the grant of the Temple to the Hospitallers,
exercised the right of appointing to the porter’s office,
and by his letter patent he promoted Roger Small to that post
for the term of his life, in return for the good service rendered
him by the said Roger Small.<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>It appears that the lawyers in the Temple had at this period
their purveyor of provisions as at present, and were then keeping
commons or dining together in the hall. The poet Chaucer, who
was born at the close of the reign of Edward II., <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1327, and
was in high favour at court in the reign of Edward III., thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
speaks of the <span class="smcap">Manciple</span>, or the purveyor of provisions of the
lawyers in the Temple:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>At the period of the dissolution of the order of the Templars
many of the retainers of the ancient knights were residing in
the Temple, supported by pensions from the crown. These
were of the class of free servants of office, they held their posts
for life, and not having been members of the order, they were
not included in the general proscription of the fraternity. On
the seizure by the sheriffs and royal officers of the property of
their ancient masters, they had been reduced to great distress,
and had petitioned the king to be allowed their customary
stipends. Edward II. had accordingly granted to Robert
Styfford clerk, chaplain of the Temple Church, two deniers a
day for his maintenance in the house of the Temple at London,
and five shillings a year for necessaries, provided he did service
in the Temple Church; and when unable to do so, he was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
receive only his food and lodging. Geoffrey Talaver, Geoffrey
de Cave, clerk, and John de Shelton, were also, each of them,
to receive for their good services, annual pensions for the term
of their lives. Some of these retainers, in addition to their
various stipends, were to have a gown of the class of free-serving
brethren of the order of the Temple each year; one old garment
out of the stock of old garments belonging to the brethren;
one mark a year for their shoes, &amp;c.; their sons also
received so much <i>per diem</i>, on condition that they did the daily
work of the house.<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> These domestics and retainers of the
ancient brotherhood of the Knights Templars, appear to have
transferred their services to the learned society of lawyers established
in the Temple, and to have continued and kept alive
amongst them many of the ancient customs and observances of
the old Knights. The chaplain of the Temple Church took his
meals in the hall with the lawyers as he had been wont to do with
the Knights Templars; and the rule of their order requiring
“two and two to eat together,” and “all the fragments to be
given in brotherly charity to the domestics,” continued to be
observed, and prevails to this day; whilst the attendants at
table continued to be, and are still called <i>paniers</i>, as in the days
of the Knights Templars.<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>In the sixth year of the reign of Edward III., (<span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1333,)
a few years after the lawyers had established themselves in the
convent of the Temple, the judges of the Court of Common
Pleas were made <span class="small">KNIGHTS</span>,<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> being the earliest instance on record
of the grant of the honour of knighthood for services purely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
civil, and the professors of the common law, who had the exclusive
privilege of practising in that court, assumed the title or
degree of <span class="small">FRERES SERJENS</span> or <span class="small">FRATRES SERVIENTES</span>, so that an
order of knights and serving-brethren was most curiously revived
in the Temple, and introduced into the profession of the
law. It is true that the word <i>serviens</i>, <i>serjen</i>, or serjeant, was
applied to the professors of the law long before the reign of
Edward III., but not to denote a <i>privileged brotherhood</i>. It was
applied to lawyers in common with all persons who did any
description of work for another, from the <i>serviens domini regis ad
legem</i>, who prosecuted the pleas of the crown in the county
court, to the <i>serviens</i> or <i>serjen</i> who walked with his cane before
the concubine of the patriarch Heraclius in the streets of Jerusalem.
The priest who worked for the Lord was called <i>serjen
de Dieu</i>, and the lover who served the lady of his affections
<i>serjen d’amour</i>. It was in the order of the Temple that the
word <i>freres</i> serjens or <i>fratres</i> servientes first signified an honorary
title or degree, and denoted a powerful privileged class of brethren.
The <i>fratres servientes armigeri</i> or <i>freres serjens des armes</i>, of
the chivalry of the Temple, were of the rank of gentlemen. They
united in their own persons the monastic and the military character,
they were allotted one horse each, they wore the cross of
the order of the Temple on their breasts, they participated in
all the privileges of the brotherhood, and were eligible to the
dignity of Preceptor. Large sums of money were frequently
given by seculars who had not been advanced to the honour of
knighthood, to be admitted amongst this highly esteemed order
of men. These <i>freres serjens</i> of the Temple wore linen <i>coifs</i>, and
red caps close over them.<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> At the ceremony of their admission
into the fraternity, the Master of the Temple placed the coif<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
upon their heads, and threw over their shoulders the white
mantle of the Temple; he then caused them to sit down on the
ground, and gave them a solemn admonition concerning the
duties and responsibilities of their profession. The knights
and Serjeants of the common law, on the other hand, have ever
constituted a privileged <i>fraternity</i>, and always address one another
by the endearing term <i>brother</i>. The religious character of
the ancient ceremony of admission into this legal brotherhood,
which took place in the Temple Church, and its striking similarity
to the ancient mode of reception into the fraternity of the
Temple, are curious and remarkable. “Capitalis Justitiarius,”
says an ancient MS. account of the creation of serjeants-at-law,
“monstrabat eis plura bona exempla de eorum prædecessoribus,
et tunc. posuit les <i>coyfes</i> super eorum capitibus, et
induebat eos singulariter de capital de skarletto, et sic creati
fuerunt <i>servientes ad legem</i>.” In his admonitory exhortation, the
chief-justice displays to them the moral and religious duties of
their profession. “Ambulate in vocatione in quâ vocati estis....
Disce cultum Dei, <i>reverentiam superioris, misericordiam
pauperi</i>.” He tells them the coif is sicut vestis <i>candida</i> et immaculata,
the emblem of purity and virtue, and he commences a
portion of his discourse in the scriptural language used by the
popes in the famous bull conceding to the Templars their vast
spiritual and temporal privileges, “<i>Omne datum optimum et omne
donum perfectum desursum est descendens a patre luminum</i>,” &amp;c. &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
It has been supposed that the coif was first introduced by the
clerical practitioners of the common law to hide the <i>tonsure</i> of
those priests who practised in the Court of Common Pleas,
notwithstanding the ecclesiastical prohibition. This was not
the case. The early portraits of our judges exhibit them with
a coif of very much larger dimensions than the coifs now worn
by the serjeants-at-law, very much larger than would be neces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>sary
to hide the <i>mere clerical tonsure</i>. A covering for that purpose
indeed would be absurd.</p>

<p>From the inquisition into the state of the Temple, taken 10
E. III., <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1337, it appears, as we have already seen, that in
the time of the Knights Templars there were <span class="small">TWO HALLS</span> in the
Temple, the one being the hall of the knights, and the other
the hall of the <i>freres serjens</i>, or serving-brethren of the order.
One of these halls, the present Inner Temple Hall, had been
assigned, the year previous to the taking of that inquisition,
to the prior and brethren of the Hospital of Saint John,
together with the church, cloisters, &amp;c., as before mentioned,
whilst the other hall remained in the hands of the crown, and
was not granted to the Hospitallers until 13 E. III., <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1340.
It was probably soon after this period that the Hospitallers conceded
the use of <i>both halls</i> to the professors of the law, and these
last, from dining apart and being attached to different halls,
at last separated into two societies. When the lawyers originally
came into the Temple as lessees of the earl of Lancaster,
they found engraved upon the ancient buildings the armorial
bearings of the order of the Temple, which were, on a shield
argent, a plain cross gules, and (<i>brochant sur le tout</i>) the holy
lamb bearing the banner of the order, surmounted by a red
cross. These arms remained the emblem of the Temple until
the fifth year of the reign of queen Elizabeth, when unfortunately
the society of the Inner Temple, yielding to the advice
and persuasion of Master Gerard Leigh, a member of the College
of Heralds, abandoned the ancient and honourable device
of the Knights Templars, and assumed in its place a galloping
winged horse called a Pegasus, or, as it has been explained to
us, “a horse striking the earth with its hoof, or <i>Pegasus luna on
a field argent</i>!” Master Gerard Leigh, we are told, “emblazoned
them with precious stones and planets, and by these
strange arms he intended to signify that the knowledge acquired
at the learned seminary of the Inner Temple would raise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
the professors of the law to the highest honours, adding, by
way of motto, <i>volat ad æthera virtus</i>, and he intended to allude
to what are esteemed the more liberal sciences, by giving
them Pegasus forming the fountain of Hippocrene, by striking
his hoof against the rock, as a proper emblem of lawyers becoming
poets, as Chaucer and Gower, who were both of the
Temple!”</p>

<p>The Society of the Middle Temple, with better taste, still preserves,
in that part of the Temple over which its sway extends,
the widely-renowned and time-honoured badge of the ancient
order of the Temple.</p>

<p>On the dissolution of the order of the Hospital of Saint John,
(32 Hen. 8,) the Temple once more reverted to the crown, and
the lawyers again became the immediate lessees of the sovereign.
In the reign of James I., however, some Scotchman attempted to
obtain from his majesty a grant of the fee simple or inheritance
of the Temple, which being brought to the knowledge of the two
law societies, they forthwith made “humble suit” to the king, and
obtained a grant of the property to themselves. By letters patent,
bearing date at Westminster the 13th of August, in the
sixth year of his reign, <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1609, king James granted the
Temple to the Benchers of the two societies, their heirs and assigns
for ever, for the lodging, reception, and education of the
professors and students of the laws of England, the said
Benchers yielding and paying to the said king, his heirs and
successors, ten pounds yearly for the mansion called the Inner
Temple, and ten pounds yearly for the Middle Temple.<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>There are but few remains of the ancient Knights Templars
now existing in the Temple beyond the <span class="smcap">Church</span>. The present
Inner Temple Hall was the ancient <span class="smcap">Hall of the Knights</span>, but
it has at different periods been so altered and repaired as to
have lost almost every trace and vestige of antiquity. In the
year 1816 it was nearly rebuilt, and the following extract from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
“The Report and Observations of the Treasurer on the late Repairs
of the Inner Temple Hall,” may prove interesting, as
showing the state of the edifice previous to that period. “From
the proportions, the state of decay, the materials of the eastern
and southern walls, the buttresses of the southern front, the
pointed form of the roof and arches, and the rude sculpture on
the two doors of public entrance, the hall is evidently of very
great antiquity.... The northern wall appears to have been
rebuilt, except at its two extremities, in modern times, but on
the old foundations.... The roof was found to be in a very
decayed and precarious state. It appeared to have undergone
reparation at three separate periods of time, at each of which
timber had been unnecessarily added, so as finally to accumulate
a weight which had protruded the northern and southern walls.
It became, therefore, indispensable to remove all the timber of
the roof, and to replace it in a lighter form. On removing the
old wainscoting of the western wall, a perpendicular crack of
considerable height and width was discovered, which threatened
at any moment the fall of that extremity of the building with its
superincumbent roof.... The turret of the clock and the
southern front of the hall are only cased with stone; this was
done in the year 1741, and very ill executed. The structure of
the turret, composed of chalk, ragstone, and rubble, (the same
material as the walls of the church,) seems to be very ancient....
The wooden cupola of the bell was so decayed as to let in
the rain, and was obliged to be renewed in a form to agree with
the other parts of the southern front.”</p>

<p>“Notwithstanding the Gothic character of the building, in
the year 1680, during the treasurership of Sir Thomas Robinson,
prothonotary of C. B., a Grecian screen of the Doric order was
erected, surmounted by lions’ heads, cones, and other incongruous
devices. In the year 1741, during the treasurership of
John Blencowe, esq., low windows of Roman architecture were
formed in the southern front. The dates of such innovations
appear from inscriptions with the respective treasurers’ names.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span></p>

<p>This ancient hall formed the far-famed refectory of the Knights
Templars, and was the scene of their proud and sumptuous hospitality.
Within its venerable walls they at different periods
entertained king John, king Henry the Third, the haughty
legates of the Roman pontiffs, and the ambassadors of foreign
powers. The old custom, alluded to by Matthew Paris, (ante,
<a href="#Page_203">p. 203</a>,) of hanging around the walls the shields and armorial
devices of the ancient knights, is still preserved, and each succeeding
treasurer of the Temple still continues to hoist his coat
of arms on the wall, as in the high and palmy days of the warlike
monks of old. Here, in the time of the Knights Templars,
the discipline was administered to disobedient brethren, who
were scourged upon their bare backs with leathern thongs.
Here also was kept, according to the depositions of the witnesses
who brought such dark and terrible accusations against the
Templars before the ecclesiastical tribunal assembled in London,
the famous black idol with shining eyes, and the gilded head,
which the Templars worshipped! and from hence was taken the
refractory knight, who having refused to spit upon the cross,
was plunged into the well which stood in the middle of the
Temple court! The general chapters of the Templars were frequently
held in the Temple Hall, and the vicar of the church of
St. Clements at Sandwich, swore before the Papal inquisitors
assembled at London, that he had heard that a boy had been
murdered by the Templars in the Temple, because he had crept
by stealth into the Hall to witness the proceedings of the assembled
brethren.</p>

<p>At the west end of the hall are considerable remains of the
ancient convent of the Knights. A groined Gothic arch of the
same style of architecture as the oldest part of the Temple
Church forms the roof of the present buttery, and in the apartment
beyond is a groined vaulted ceiling of great beauty. The
ribs of the arches in both rooms are elegantly moulded, but are
sadly disfigured with a thick coating of plaster and barbarous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
whitewash. In the cellars underneath these rooms are some old
walls of immense thickness, the remains of an ancient window,
a curious fireplace, and some elegant pointed Gothic arches corresponding
with the ceilings above; but they are now, alas!
shrouded in darkness, choked with modern brick partitions and
staircases, and soiled with the damp and dust of many centuries.
These interesting remains form an upper and an under story,
the floor of the upper story being on a level with the floor of the
hall, and the floor of the under story on a level with the terrace
on the south side thereof. They were formerly connected with
the church by means of a covered way or cloister, which ran at
right angles with them over the site of the present cloister-chambers,
and communicated with the upper and under story of
the chapel of St. Anne, which formerly stood on the south side
of the church. By means of this corridor and chapel the brethren
of the Temple had private access to the church for the
performance of their strict religious duties, and of their secret
ceremonies of admitting novices to the vows of the order. In 9
Jac. I., <span class="small">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1612, some brick buildings three stories high were
erected over this ancient cloister by Francis Tate, esq., and being
burnt down a few years afterwards, the interesting covered way
which connected the church with the ancient convent was involved
in the general destruction, as appears from the following
inscription upon the present buildings:&mdash;<span class="smcap">Vetustissima Templariorum
porticu igne consumpta, anno 1678, Nova hæc, sumptibus
Medii Templi extructa, anno 1681, Gulielmo Whitelocke armigero,
thesaurario</span>. “The very ancient portico of the Templars
being consumed by fire in the year 1678, these new buildings
were erected at the expense of the Middle Temple in the year
1681, during the treasurership of William Whitelocke, esq.”</p>

<p>The cloisters of the Templars formed the medium of communication
between the halls, of the church, and the cells of the
serving brethren of the order. During the formation of the present
new entrance into the Temple, by the church, at the bottom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
of the Inner Temple lane, a considerable portion of the brickwork
of the old houses was pulled down, and an ancient wall of
great thickness was disclosed. It was composed of chalk, ragstone,
and rubble, exactly resembling the walls of the church.
It ran in a direction east and west, and appeared to have formed
the extreme northern boundary of the old convent. The exact
site of the remaining buildings of the ancient Temple cannot
now be determined with certainty.</p>

<p>Among the many interesting objects to be seen in the ancient
church of the Knights Templars which still exists in a wonderful
state of preservation, is the <span class="smcap">Penitential Cell</span>, a dreary place of
solitary confinement formed within the thick wall of the building,
only four feet six inches long and two feet six inches wide,
so narrow and small that a grown person cannot lie down within
it.<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> In this narrow prison the disobedient brethren of the ancient
Templars were temporarily confined in chains and fetters,
“in order that their souls might be saved from the eternal
prison of hell.” The hinges and catch of a door firmly attached
to the doorway of this dreary chamber still remain, and at the
bottom of the staircase is a stone recess or cupboard, where
bread and water were placed for the prisoner. In this cell Brother
Walter le Bachelor, Knight, Grand Preceptor of Ireland, is
said to have been starved to death.</p>
